                    <li>how to judge a decision (good or bad) if you cant know what would happen if you decided for the other options?</li>
                    <li>can decisions be attributed to the skill of a person in a world full of complex and unpredictable forces? or are the decisions decided for us by the environment we live in and the inherent biology of our body and thus creating an illusion of control and merit?</li>
                    <li>how to live life optimally? what to focus our energy on?<li>
                </ul>

                    <li>does it have evolutionary roots?</li>
                    <li>will the tendency </li>

                    <li>what are our inherent human needs?</li>
                    <li>why are we numb to all the forces that shape our actions when not actively thinking about it?</li>
                    <li>what if we were free of biological constrains? is it possible or is our consciousness just a representation of our biological structure? could we transcend into a different world?</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>arguing</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>why do people argue for the sake of arguing? does it have an evolutionary explanation?</li>
                    <li>what is arguing for if the ones arguing arent willing to come to a conclusion and learn from it in order to not make the same mistake the next time?</li>
                    <li>how to navigate through an argument where facts are overlooked? what if the facts arent aligned with the emotion of the other one? should you respect their emotion and set aside the facts?</li>
                    <li>do emotions stand in a way to come to the conclusion?</li>
                    <li>why cant people just isolate the problem from their oneself?</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>why dont we spend more resources on prevention rather than the cure?</li>
                    <li>could we abuse our human biological weaknesses in order to propell civilization forward rather than to manipulate people and make money by gambling, advertising, etc..</li>
                    <li>do civilizations go through cycles: using resources well to wasting? is rich western civilization in its late stage where it wastes?</li>
                    <li>in what way social networks shape our actions and values? what are the implications?</li>
