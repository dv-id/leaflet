                    <li>
                        <p>Microeconomics (1401) focuses on individuals, households, and firms.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Macroeconomics deals with larger economic factors such as national income, inflation rates,
                            and unemployment levels.</p>

                <p>The relationship between wage growth and inflation is a key interest. Higher wages can lead to

        <p>Understanding the potential for a recession is fundamental in macroeconomics. A recession typically refers to
            a decline in aggregate output, which can be observed through surveys conducted on economists. These
            economists are often tasked with assessing the probability of recession within a specified timeframe (in
            this case, 12 months). The prevailing sentiment regarding economic downturns illustrates a significant
            reliance on models that determine equilibrium output.</p>

        <h3 id="aggregate-demand-components">Aggregate Demand Components</h3>
        <p>Aggregate demand (<span class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span>) is composed of the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Consumption</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>): Goods and services
                    purchased by households.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Investment</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>I</em></span>): Non-residential and
                    residential investments.</p>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Government Spending</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>): Purchases by
                    federal, state, and local governments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Exports</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>): Purchases of U.S. goods by
                    global consumers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Imports</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>I</em><em>M</em></span>): Purchases of
                    foreign goods by U.S. consumers.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The equation for aggregate demand in a closed economy (disregarding <span
                class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>I</em><em>M</em></span>) can be
            expressed as: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Z</em> = <em>C</em> + <em>I</em> + <em>G</em></span><br /></p>
        <p>For the purposes of this course: <br /><span

                spending are constants)</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="defining-consumption">Defining Consumption</h4>
        <p>Consumption is defined as an increasing function of disposable income. The function capturing consumption can
            be expressed as: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>C</em> = <em>C</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>C</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>Y</em> − <em>T</em>)</span><br />
            where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>0</sub></span> is autonomous consumption.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> is the total income/output.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> is taxes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is crucial to note that <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> (MPC) is valued between 0
            and 1; as income increases, consumption increases at a diminishing rate.</p>
        <h3 id="equilibrium-output">Equilibrium Output</h3>
        <p>The equilibrium output in an economy is determined at the point where aggregate demand equals total output:
            <br /><span class="math display"><em>Y</em> = <em>Z</em></span><br /> Inserting the expression for aggregate
            demand provides: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Y</em> = <em>C</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>C</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>Y</em> − <em>T</em>) + <em>G</em></span><br />
        </p>
        <p>Rearranging this yields the fundamental equation for equilibrium output: <br /><span class="math display">$$Y
                = \frac{C_0 + G + C_1 T}{1 - C_1}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>This formula highlights the multiplier effect, which is defined as: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - C_1}$$</span><br /> The multiplier serves to
            amplify the effects of changes in consumption, government spending, or taxes on overall output.</p>
        <h4 id="the-multipliers-role">The Multiplier’s Role</h4>
        <p>The size of the multiplier indicates the effectiveness of fiscal policies. Higher values of <span
                class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span> enhance the multiplier, leading to a more significant
            increase in equilibrium output following a change in expenditures.</p>
        <h3 id="shifts-in-aggregate-demand">Shifts in Aggregate Demand</h3>
        <p>Consider the scenario where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>0</sub></span> (autonomous consumption)
            increases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The initial increase in consumption leads to an upward shift in aggregate demand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Output will initially increase by the same amount as the change in <span
                        class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>0</sub></span> due to the short-run nature of the model.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subsequent iterations of increased income from the initial consumption will further increase demand,
            showcasing the multiplier effect in action.</p>
        <h4 id="the-paradox-of-savings">The Paradox of Savings</h4>
        <p>While saving is generally encouraged, an increase in overall savings can paradoxically lead to a decrease in
            equilibrium output when measured macroeconomically. This can occur due to the multiplier effect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Higher saving decreases consumption for any given level of income.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As consumption falls, demand decreases, leading to lower output.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ultimately, lower output results in less income, which further decreases consumption.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This insight underscores the complexity of macroeconomic dynamics compared to microeconomic theories.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In summary, this lecture has introduced the foundational concepts of aggregate demand, the nature of
            consumption, and the mechanics behind equilibrium output. The intricacies of the multiplier effect and the
            potential paradox of increased savings highlight how interconnected macroeconomic factors can be.
            Understanding these principles is vital as we delve deeper into macroeconomic analysis in upcoming lectures.

        <p>Before delving into the IS-LM model, let’s examine the current state of the U.S. economy and its impact on
            aggregate demand.</p>
        <h4 id="net-worth-and-wealth-trends">Net Worth and Wealth Trends</h4>
        <p>Household wealth, composed primarily of net worth, shows a general upward trend, with notable declines during
            recessions, including the COVID-19 recession. However, post-recession, there has been a significant recovery
            in asset prices, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Recovery in equity markets</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Surging house prices</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite the downturn in 2022, the overall wealth increase is notable. Increased household wealth typically
            leads to increased consumption and hence higher aggregate demand.</p>
        <h4 id="factors-contributing-to-increases-in-wealth">Factors Contributing to Increases in Wealth</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Government Transfers: Large governmental monetary transfers helped maintain incomes, particularly for
                    lower-income households during COVID-19, leading to increased savings.</p>

                    trillion in excess savings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As the economy reopens, pent-up demand manifests as increased spending, especially in sectors like
                    travel and hospitality, further pressuring aggregate demand.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="understanding-aggregate-demand">Understanding Aggregate Demand</h3>
        <p>Aggregate demand is influenced by both consumer wealth and spending behavior. The relationship can be

        <h4 id="construction-of-the-lm-curve">Construction of the LM Curve</h4>
        <p>The LM curve reflects equilibrium in the money market, where real money supply equals real money demand:

        <p>The LM curve is typically upward sloping, indicating that as output (<span

        <h4 id="modern-monetary-policy">Modern Monetary Policy</h4>
        <p>In the current context, central banks set interest rates directly rather than targeting money supply. This

        <h3 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The IS-LM model is foundational in macroeconomics and provides insight into the interactions between the
            goods market (IS) and the money market (LM). This lecture will extend the IS-LM model in two key dimensions:
            the distinction between nominal and real interest rates, and the incorporation of credit spreads in
            corporate borrowing.</p>
        <h3 id="nominal-vs.-real-interest-rates">Nominal vs. Real Interest Rates</h3>
        <h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Nominal Interest Rate</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>): The interest
                    rate expressed in monetary terms (in dollars). For example, if the nominal interest rate is 10%, an
                    investment of $100 will yield $10 in interest after one year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Real Interest Rate</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>): The interest rate
                    adjusted for inflation, reflecting the true cost of borrowing in terms of a basket of goods. The
                    real interest rate can be approximated as: <br /><span
                        class="math display"><em>r</em> ≈ <em>i</em> − <em>π</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span><br />
                    where <span class="math inline"><em>π</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span> is the expected inflation
                    rate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="why-real-interest-rates-matter">Why Real Interest Rates Matter</h4>
        <p>The real interest rate influences significant investment decisions in the private sector. For durable goods
            consumer purchases and physical investment, it is the real rate, not the nominal rate, that matters because
            it represents the opportunity cost of investment adjusted for inflation.</p>
        <h3 id="derivation-of-the-real-interest-rate">Derivation of the Real Interest Rate</h3>
        <p>To derive the real interest rate, we equate the returns from nominal bonds and real goods: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$1 + r = (1 + i) \frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}}^e$$</span><br /> From this, we can rearrange
            to express it in terms of expected inflation: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>r</em> ≈ <em>i</em> − <em>π</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="impact-of-inflation-and-credit-spreads-on-the-is-lm-model">Impact of Inflation and Credit Spreads on the
            IS-LM Model</h3>
        <h4 id="credit-spreads">Credit Spreads</h4>
        <p>Most corporate bonds are considered risky. The interest rate on these bonds can be represented as:
            <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>r</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> = <em>r</em> + <em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the risk premium reflecting the
            higher borrowing costs associated with corporate lending compared to treasuries.</p>
        <h4 id="risk-premium-dynamics">Risk Premium Dynamics</h4>
        <p>The risk premium, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, increases in response to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>An increased probability of default (<span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heightened risk aversion from investors.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>During recessions, both factors can amplify, causing a significant increase in the credit spread.</p>
        <h3 id="modifications-to-the-is-lm-model">Modifications to the IS-LM Model</h3>
        <p>The modifications include: 1. Replacing the nominal interest rate in the investment function with the real
            interest rate adjusted by credit risk: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>I</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>r</em> − <em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>Y</em>)</span><br />
        </p>
        <h4 id="shifts-in-the-zz-curve">Shifts in the ZZ Curve</h4>
        <p>An increase in expected inflation (<span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>) or a decrease in credit
            spreads (<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>) will shift the ZZ curve upwards,
            mimicking the effects of expansionary monetary policy: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>Y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>Δ</em><em>π</em>,  − <em>Δ</em><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)</span><br />
        </p>
        <p>Conversely, during financial crises: Increases in the risk premium and declines in expected inflation shift
            the ZZ curve downwards.</p>
        <h3 id="recent-economic-context">Recent Economic Context</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The Great Recession (2008-2009) where nominal rates were reduced aggressively while real rates
                    remained high due to declining expected inflation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The COVID-19 economic shock led to a similar drop in expected inflation but also required central
                    banks to reduce nominal rates to near zero.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Recently, the interplay between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and credit spreads has
                    resulted in challenges for monetary policy, particularly as expected inflation has begun to rise
                    again.</p>

            the unemployment rate, and <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> represents labor market institutions

            is a markup.</p>
        <p>The wage-setting equation reflects that as unemployment <span class="math inline"><em>u</em></span> rises,
            wage demand <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> decreases, and as <span
                class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> increases, wage demand increases.</p>
        <h4 id="deriving-the-phillips-curve">Deriving the Phillips Curve</h4>
        <p>Starting with the relationship between inflation and the price level: <br /><span class="math display">$$\pi
                = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1$$</span><br /> Rearranging this in terms of
            expected inflation gives: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>P</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = (1 + <em>π</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>)<em>P</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub></span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>π</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> is expected inflation.</p>
        <p>Substituting in both the wage and price equations ultimately leads us to the relation: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>π</em> = <em>π</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> − <em>α</em>(<em>u</em> − <em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> is the natural rate of unemployment,
            a key concept in understanding inflation dynamics.</p>
        <h3 id="natural-rate-of-unemployment-1">Natural Rate of Unemployment</h3>
        <p>The natural rate of unemployment <span class="math inline"><em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> satisfies
            the conditions where expected inflation equals actual inflation. Mathematically: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>F</em><sup> − 1</sup>(<em>π</em>, <em>z</em>)</span><br />
            This means that higher <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> or <span
                class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> leads to an increase in <span
                class="math inline"><em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> due to changes in bargaining power of

                class="math inline"><em>u</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span></h4>
        <p>An increase in <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> leads to a higher required wage from workers, but
            firms can only afford to pay a lower wage, leading to higher unemployment <span

        <h3 id="expected-inflation-and-phillips-curve-dynamics">Expected Inflation and Phillips Curve Dynamics</h3>
        <p>At the core of the Phillips curve is the assumption about inflation expectations: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>π</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> = <em>E</em>[<em>π</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub>]</span><br />
            Where <span class="math inline"><em>E</em>[ ⋅ ]</span> denotes the expectation operator. When expectations
            are well anchored, especially at low values of inflation, the Phillips curve maintains its downward slope.
        </p>
        <h4 id="shift-in-expectations">Shift in Expectations</h4>
        <p>If inflation expectations are disanchored (such as during the 1970s), the relationship can break down, as
            seen from historical data where inflation accelerated despite high unemployment due to expected inflation
            catching up with realized inflation.</p>
        <h4 id="dynamic-model-of-expectations">Dynamic Model of Expectations</h4>
        <p>In a dynamic world, expected inflation can be modeled as: <br /><span

            where <span class="math inline"><em>π̄</em></span> is the target inflation rate (often around 2</p>
        <p>The implication is that if <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> approaches 1, expected inflation
            becomes much more responsive to previous inflation shocks, leading to persistent inflation against earlier
            Phillips curves.</p>

        <p>When comparing GDP per capita across countries, adjustments are necessary to account for price level

            following hypothetical scenario:</p>
        <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
        <p>Assume two economies:</p>

        <h3 id="balanced-growth-theory">Balanced Growth Theory</h3>
        <p>A balanced growth model assumes that all relevant variables grow at the same rate. This can be illustrated
            through the following:<br />
            <strong>1. Normalized Variables:</strong> <br /><span

        </ul>
        <p><strong>2. Growth Rates:</strong> - The growth rate of output per effective worker is given by: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em></sub> = (1 − <em>α</em>)<em>g</em><sub><em>K</em></sub> + <em>α</em>(<em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> + <em>g</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>)</span><br />

            <strong>3. Steady State Growth:</strong> In steady state, the growth rates for key variables are:
            <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>K</em></sub> = <em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> + <em>g</em><sub><em>N</em></sub></span><br />

        <h3 id="measuring-technological-progress">Measuring Technological Progress</h3>
        <p>To measure the rate of technological change (<span
                class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>), we can utilize the following formula based
            on the contributions of labor and capital:<br />
            <strong>1. Contribution from Labor:</strong> <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em>|<em>N</em></sub> = <em>α</em> ⋅ <em>g</em><sub><em>N</em></sub></span><br />
            Where:<br />
            <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em>|<em>N</em></sub></span> = Growth of output due to growth
            in employment<br />
            <strong>2. Contribution from Capital:</strong> <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em>|<em>K</em></sub> = (1 − <em>α</em>) ⋅ <em>g</em><sub><em>K</em></sub></span><br />
            The total growth of output can be decomposed as follows: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em></sub> = <em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em>|<em>N</em></sub> + <em>g</em><sub><em>Y</em>|<em>K</em></sub> + <em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span><br />
            The residual (<span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span>) represents technological

        <p>These contributors can be expressed in terms of the relative output and saving rates.</p>
        <h3 id="transitional-growth">Transitional Growth</h3>
        <p>Transitional growth occurs when a country is below its steady-state level, leading to faster growth due to
            capital accumulation.<br />

        <h3 id="condition-for-balanced-growth">Condition for Balanced Growth</h3>
        <p>In the context of an extended model to include human capital (<span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>):
            1. Human capital model: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Y</em> = <em>A</em> ⋅ <em>H</em><sup><em>h</em></sup> ⋅ <em>K</em><sup>1 − <em>α</em></sup></span><br />
            2. Steady states will still yield <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span
                class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> as before. If education is increased, the
            model predicts higher output without changing the growth dynamics fundamentally.</p>
        <h3 id="education-and-income-disparities">Education and Income Disparities</h3>
        <p>Education plays a crucial role in explaining differences in income per capita across countries. A rise in
            average years of schooling contributes positively to human capital: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>H</em></sub> = 0.1 ⋅ <em>Δ</em><em>Y</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>s</em> <em>o</em><em>f</em> <em>S</em><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em></span><br />
        </p>
        <p>Empirical findings suggest that countries with higher education often exhibit higher income per capita:
            <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>A</em> ⋅ <em>H</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>α</em></sup> ⋅ <em>K</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup>1 − <em>α</em></sup></span><br />
        </p>
        <h3 id="evaluating-income-disparities">Evaluating Income Disparities</h3>
        <p>Despite accounting for savings rates and education, significant income disparities remain. The Solow Residual
            continues to play a vital role, indicating that technology levels vary drastically worldwide.</p>
        <p>1. The relative technology output levels across countries: <br /><span class="math display">$$A_i =
                \frac{Y_i}{K_i^{1-\alpha}H_i^{\alpha}}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>This allows for considerable insights into how much of the output per worker disparities can be attributed to
            technology differences.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-11">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>While models like the Solow model provide substantial insight, they struggle to account for variations in
            growth rates and income levels as affected by diverse factors, particularly those relating to institutions
            and technology adoption rates.</p>
        <p>Future discussions will encompass the dynamics of open economies and integrate these modern growth theories

        <p>As economies begin to reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been <strong>excess demand over
                supply</strong>. The expected potential output, as described in the IS-LM-PC model, was slow to recover
            due to:</p>
        <ul>

            increasingly exposed to each other’s economic conditions. This is particularly relevant as global events can
            have amplified impacts across integrated economies.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-12">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The U.S. economy is currently at a critical juncture, balancing the need for continued rate hikes to combat
            inflation while navigating the implications of a potential credit crunch that could lead to a slowdown.
            Understanding these dynamics in both closed and open economy contexts is vital for policymakers and
            economists alike.</p>

            Economy</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-11">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The lecture focuses on the IS-LM model, revisiting it within the context of an open economy. The key concepts
            discussed will include openness in goods and capital markets, real exchange rates, and demand for domestic
            versus foreign goods.</p>
        <h3 id="concept-of-openness">Concept of Openness</h3>
        <p>Openness in an economy can be defined in two major aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Goods Market Openness:</strong> The ability to buy goods from both home and abroad, which
                    introduces the concept of relative prices and the real exchange rate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Financial Market Openness:</strong> The ability to invest in both domestic and foreign
                    assets, requiring an understanding of expected relative returns.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="real-exchange-rate">Real Exchange Rate</h4>
        <p>The real exchange rate (<span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>) is defined as: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$\epsilon = \frac{P^*}{P} \cdot E$$</span><br /> where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sup>*</sup></span> = Price level abroad</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> = Price level domestically</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> = Exchange rate (price of domestic currency in terms of
                    foreign currency)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A rise in <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span> indicates a real appreciation of the domestic currency,
            meaning domestic goods become more expensive than foreign goods. Conversely, a fall in <span
                class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span> indicates a depreciation.</p>
        <h3 id="investment-and-returns">Investment and Returns</h3>
        <p>When considering investments, comparing the expected returns on domestic assets with foreign assets is
            crucial:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>For a domestic bond with interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>, the future value
                    is: <br /><span

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For a foreign bond with interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sup>*</sup></span>, after
                    converting currency at expected future exchange rate <span
                        class="math inline"><em>E</em><sup>*</sup></span>: <br /><span
                        class="math display">$$FV_{foreign} = \frac{(1 + i^*) \cdot P^*}{E^*}$$</span><br /></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="uncovered-interest-parity-condition">Uncovered Interest Parity Condition</h4>
        <p>The equilibrium condition for investors is given by: <br /><span class="math display">$$(1 + i) = (1 + i^*)
                \cdot \frac{E}{E^*}$$</span><br /> Where it states that interest rates must be equal when adjusted for
            expected changes in exchange rates.</p>
        <h3 id="demand-for-domestic-versus-foreign-goods">Demand for Domestic versus Foreign Goods</h3>
        <p>In an open economy, we distinguish between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Domestic Demand (<span class="math inline"><em>D</em><em>D</em></span>)</strong>: Consumption
                    (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>) + Investment (<span

                        class="math display"><em>D</em><em>D</em> = <em>C</em> + <em>I</em> + <em>G</em></span><br />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Demand for Domestic Goods (<span class="math inline"><em>Z</em><em>Z</em></span>)</strong>:
                    <br /><span
                        class="math display"><em>Z</em><em>Z</em> = <em>D</em><em>D</em> − <em>M</em> + <em>X</em></span><br />
                    Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>: Imports (function of <span
                                class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>, domestic output)</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><span class="math inline"><em>X</em></span>: Exports (function of <span

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="behavioral-assumptions">Behavioral Assumptions</h4>
        <p>- Exports increase as foreign output (<span class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sup>*</sup></span>) increases and
            decrease with an increase in the real exchange rate (<span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>):
            <br /><span class="math display"><em>X</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>Y</em><sup>*</sup>, <em>ϵ</em>)</span><br /> -
            Imports increase with domestic output (<span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>) and also with the real
            exchange rate (<span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>): <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>M</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>Y</em>, <em>ϵ</em>)</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="equilibrium-output-2">Equilibrium Output</h3>
        <p>To find equilibrium output, we use: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>Y</em> = <em>Z</em><em>Z</em></span><br /> Where the intersection of the <span
                class="math inline"><em>Z</em><em>Z</em></span> (demand for domestic goods) and the 45-degree line gives
            us equilibrium output.</p>
        <h3 id="multipliers-in-open-economies">Multipliers in Open Economies</h3>
        <p>The open economy has a lower multiplier effect due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Part of any increase in demand being satisfied by imports</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hence the multiplier effect is tempered by the leakages to imports.</p>
        <h3 id="effects-of-currency-depreciation">Effects of Currency Depreciation</h3>
        <p>If a country faces a trade deficit and seeks to improve it through currency depreciation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Depreciation improves net exports, shifting the net export function up.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>However, this is also expansionary, potentially increasing domestic output.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="policy-implications">Policy Implications</h4>
        <p>To balance the expansion caused by depreciation, a government may choose to reduce spending or implement
            fiscal contraction.</p>
        <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
        <p>The main learnings from this lecture include: - Differentiation between domestic demand and demand for
            domestic goods. - Understanding how exchange rates influence exports and imports. - Recognizing the
            implications of an open economy on multipliers and trade balances.</p>

        <p>This lecture prepares us for the upcoming integration with financial markets in the context of the

        <h3 id="introduction-12">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Mundell-Fleming model is a critical tool for understanding the interactions between exchange rates,
            interest rates, and output in an open economy. The model is particularly important for short-term economic
            analysis and is likely to be a key focus for quizzes and examinations.</p>
        <h3 id="exchange-rates">Exchange Rates</h3>
        <h4 id="definition-and-interpretation">Definition and Interpretation</h4>
        <p>In this course, we define an increase in the exchange rate as an appreciation of the domestic currency (the
            dollar). Conversely, a decrease signifies a depreciation.</p>
        <h4 id="key-observations">Key Observations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The dollar has appreciated significantly relative to the euro and depreciated regarding the Japanese
                    yen over recent years.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Fluctuations in exchange rates are influenced by investors’ perceptions of interest rate policies

        </ul>
        <h3 id="key-economic-concepts">Key Economic Concepts</h3>
        <h4 id="uncovered-interest-parity">Uncovered Interest Parity</h4>
        <p>The Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) condition is fundamental to the Mundell-Fleming model, expressing the
            relationship between exchange rates and interest rates. <br /><span class="math display">$$E_t =
                \frac{(1+i_d)}{(1+i_f)}E_{t+1}$$</span><br /> Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> = nominal exchange rate today</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span> = domestic interest rate</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> = foreign interest rate</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub></span> = expected nominal exchange rate
                    next period</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The principle behind UIP is that the expected rate of return on domestic assets must equal that of foreign
            assets when adjusted for exchange rate expectations.</p>
        <h3 id="net-exports-function">Net Exports Function</h3>
        <p>Net exports (NX) influence aggregate demand. The NX function is influenced by three factors: <br /><span

        <p>Exchange rate arrangements can be broadly classified into floating (flexible) and fixed (pegged) regimes.</p>
        <h4 id="floating-exchange-rate-regime">Floating Exchange Rate Regime</h4>
        <p>In a floating exchange rate regime, currency values are determined by market forces. Advantages include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Monetary policy autonomy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The ability to absorb external shocks via exchange rate adjustments.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Increased volatility in exchange rates, complicating international trade and investment.</p>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="fixed-exchange-rate-regime">Fixed Exchange Rate Regime</h4>
        <p>A fixed exchange rate regime involves pegging a currency to another major currency.</p>

        <h3 id="monetary-and-fiscal-policy-implications">Monetary and Fiscal Policy Implications</h3>
        <p>In a recession, countries in different regimes respond differently:</p>
        <h4 id="flexible-exchange-rate">Flexible Exchange Rate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Expansionary fiscal policy is pursued alongside lowering interest rates, leading to currency
                    depreciation and increased net exports.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="fixed-exchange-rate">Fixed Exchange Rate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Fiscal policy can be expansionary, but the country cannot pursue independent monetary policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>During a recession not aligned with the economic cycle of the pegged currency, the country cannot
                    effectively respond with monetary tools.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="speculative-attacks">Speculative Attacks</h3>
        <p>Countries with fixed exchange rates may face speculative attacks if markets do not believe in the
            sustainability of the peg. To defend against such attacks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Interest rates must be raised to maintain the fixed exchange rate, which can lead to domestic
                    recession.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-15">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The choice between exchange rate regimes is multifaceted and involves a trade-off between stability and
            policy autonomy. Countries may choose fixed exchange rates to combat inflation or stabilize their economy,
            while flexible regimes provide greater policy freedom but expose countries to excess volatility.</p>

        <h3 id="news-and-expectations">News and Expectations</h3>
        <p>Recent bank collapses, such as Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, exemplify the power of

        <p>The S&amp;P 500 serves as a primary equity index in the U.S. market, capturing movements of large companies.
            Major swings in the index can be attributed to changes in expectations about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Future economic conditions</p>
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For instance, the index dropped by 35% at the onset of COVID-19 and rallied by 114% by late 2021, only to

        <h3 id="expected-present-discounted-value">Expected Present Discounted Value</h3>
        <p>To determine if the price of an asset today is fair, we calculate its expected present discounted value
            (EPDV). This concept combines several critical elements:</p>
        <h4 id="key-concepts-5">Key Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Expectation:</strong> Anticipated future returns.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Present Value:</strong> Current worth of future cash flows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Discounting:</strong> Future cash flows are considered less valuable than cash flows received
                    today, typically utilizing the current interest rate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="calculation-of-present-value">Calculation of Present Value</h4>
        <p>The present value of a cash flow <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, received
            at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, can be generally represented as: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$PV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{Z_t}{(1+i_t)^t}$$</span><br /> Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the interest rate applicable at
                    time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If cash flows are known and consist of constant payments <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span> over
            <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> periods with a constant interest rate <span
                class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>, then the present value can be simplified to: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$PV = Z \cdot \frac{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}{i}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="discounting-future-payments">Discounting Future Payments</h4>
        <p>If you expect $1 one year from now, it can be discounted at the interest rate <span
                class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>: <br /><span class="math display">$$PV(1 \text{ year}) =
                \frac{1}{1+i}$$</span><br /> Extending this, for $1 received two years from now, we have: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$PV(2 \text{ years}) = \frac{1}{(1+i)^2}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="pricing-bonds">Pricing Bonds</h3>
        <p>Bonds have varying maturities and coupon structures. The price of a bond can be determined using the present
            discounted value framework.</p>
        <h4 id="yield-to-maturity">Yield to Maturity</h4>
        <p>Yield to maturity (YTM) is defined as the constant annual interest rate that equates the present value of a
            bond’s future cash flows to its current price. It can be calculated using: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + YTM)^t}$$</span><br /> Where <span
                class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> represents cash flows (coupon and face value
            payments).</p>
        <h4 id="inversion-and-curve-steepness">Inversion and Curve Steepness</h4>
        <p>The yield curve illustrates the relationship between the yield and maturity of bonds. It can become inverted,
            indicating expectations of falling interest rates or economic downturns.</p>
        <h4 id="constant-interest-rate-approximation">Constant Interest Rate Approximation</h4>
        <p>If the interest rates are expected to remain constant, the yield to maturity can be approximated as an
            average of the expected future rates: <br /><span class="math display">$$YTM_2 \approx \frac{i_1 +

        <h3 id="conclusion-16">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding expectations and their impact on financial assets is vital for evaluating investments and

        <h1 id="notes-on-asset-pricing">Notes on Asset Pricing</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-asset-pricing">Introduction to Asset Pricing</h3>
        <p>Asset pricing is centered on the notion that the payoff from an asset occurs in the future. This involves
            three key elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Valuation of Future Returns:</strong> We need to establish a method to express future returns
                    in terms of today’s dollars.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Expectations:</strong> Since payoffs are in the future, we must hold expectations about them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Given that numerous events may occur between now and the payoff, assets carry
                    an inherent risk.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="present-value-calculation">Present Value Calculation</h3>
        <p>To value a future cash flow, we need to understand its present value (PV). The present value calculation
            hinges on the idea that money today can earn interest.</p>
        <h4 id="valuing-1-in-the-future">Valuing $1 in the Future</h4>
        <p>To value $1 received next year: <br /><span class="math display">$$PV = \frac{1}{1 + r}$$</span><br /> where
            <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the interest rate. If you have $1 today, investing it at rate
            <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> yields: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>F</em><em>V</em> = 1(1 + <em>r</em>) = 1 + <em>r</em></span><br />
            Consequently, the present value of a future cash flow is discounted by the interest rate.</p>
        <h4 id="multiple-periods">Multiple Periods</h4>
        <p>For cash flows over <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> years, the present discounted value of cash
            flows <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> for <span
                class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> years would be: <br /><span class="math display">$$PV =
                \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{Z_t}{(1 + r)^t}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="expected-present-value">Expected Present Value</h3>
        <p>If we introduce uncertainties in payoffs and interest rates, we adjust our calculations based on
            expectations, such that: <br /><span class="math display">$$PV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{\mathbb{E}[Z_t]}{(1 +
                \mathbb{E}[r])^t}$$</span><br /> where <span
                class="math inline">𝔼[<em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>]</span> and <span
                class="math inline">𝔼[<em>r</em>]</span> denote the expected cash flows and interest rates,
            respectively.</p>
        <h4 id="special-cases">Special Cases</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is constant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the cash flows <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> are constant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If both are constant (for bonds maturing in <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> years).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For perpetuities, where cash flows extend indefinitely.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="bond-pricing">Bond Pricing</h3>
        <p>Bonds promise fixed cash flows over time. For a simple bond paying $100 at maturity with a price denoted as
            <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>: <br /><span class="math display">$$P_t =
                \frac{100}{1 + r}$$</span><br /> For multi-period bonds, say a two-year bond: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$P_t = \frac{100}{(1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)}$$</span><br /> where <span
                class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
                class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub>2</sub></span> are the one-year interest rates at times <span
                class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> + 1</span>, respectively.
        </p>
        <h4 id="arbitrage-pricing">Arbitrage Pricing</h4>
        <p>Two instruments with the same maturity should yield comparable returns. This leads to the principle of
            arbitrage: <br /><span class="math display">Return from a one-year bond = Expected return from holding a
                two-year bond for a year</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="bond-yields">Bond Yields</h4>
        <p>The yield on a bond is the constant interest rate that equates the present value of expected cash flows to
            the price of the bond: <br /><span class="math display">$$P_t = \frac{100}{(1 + y)^2}$$</span><br /> The
            yield is often interpreted as an average of expected future interest rates.</p>

        <p>Stocks differ from bonds primarily:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Stocks pay dividends rather than fixed interest payments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stocks don’t have a fixed maturity, and their cash flows can extend indefinitely.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="equity-price-calculation">Equity Price Calculation</h4>
        <p>For a stock priced <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> with expected dividend <span
                class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> and price <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> after one
            year, the expected return on equity can be modeled as: <br /><span class="math display">$$Q = \frac{D}{(1 +
                r + x_s)} + \frac{P_{t+1}}{(1 + r + x_s)}$$</span><br /> where <span
                class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> is the risk premium for equity investments.
        </p>
        <p>The price <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> can be rearranged to capture the expected dividends and
            future price: <br /><span class="math display">$$Q = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_t}{(1 + r +
                x_s)^t}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="monetary-policy-impact">Monetary Policy Impact</h3>
        <p>An expansionary monetary policy (a decrease in interest rates) influences the price of both bonds and stocks
            by reducing discount rates. Thus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The price of bonds increases as the discounting on future cash flows diminishes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The price of stocks also tends to rise due to similar discounting effects, as well as enhanced
                    expected future revenues due to increased consumer spending.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="consumer-spending-impact">Consumer Spending Impact</h4>
        <p>An increase in consumer spending may have a dual effect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Positive: Higher expected revenues and dividends.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Negative: Anticipation of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve to manage inflation, leading
                    to higher interest rates and lower prices.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="risk-premium-dynamics-1">Risk Premium Dynamics</h4>
        <p>The risk premium, particularly in equity markets, is sensitive to economic conditions, which can lead to
            significant fluctuations in asset prices, indicating high market volatility especially during economic
            crises.</p>
        <h3 id="bubbles-and-market-psychology">Bubbles and Market Psychology</h3>
        <p>Asset prices can exhibit irrational exuberance leading to bubbles, characterized by unsustainable price
            increases. Historical examples show that when asset prices soar without fundamental backing, they often
            decline sharply, emphasizing the importance of market psychology in asset pricing.</p>

            Consumption and Investment</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-15">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Expectations play a significant role in economics, especially in asset pricing and the broader economic
            models discussed throughout the course. This document provides a detailed exploration of how expectations
            affect consumption and investment using the IS-LM model as a framework.</p>
        <h3 id="the-role-of-expectations-in-economics">The Role of Expectations in Economics</h3>
        <h4 id="understanding-expectations">Understanding Expectations</h4>
        <p>Economics heavily relies on expectations about the future. All economic actors—investors, consumers, firms,
            and governments—base their decisions on anticipated future conditions rather than solely current conditions.
        </p>
        <h4 id="key-concepts-6">Key Concepts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Permanent Income Hypothesis (Milton Friedman)</strong>: Consumption decisions depend more on
                    expected lifetime income than on current income.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Life-cycle Hypothesis (Franco Modigliani)</strong>: Individuals plan for their consumption
                    based on expected income over their lifetime rather than short-term fluctuations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="consumption-function">Consumption Function</h3>
        <h4 id="traditional-consumption-function">Traditional Consumption Function</h4>
        <p>Traditionally, consumption (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>) was modeled as a function of current
            disposable income (<span class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span>): <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>C</em> = <em>C</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>c</em> ⋅ <em>Y</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>0</sub></span> is autonomous consumption and <span
                class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> is the marginal propensity to consume.</p>
        <h4 id="permanent-vs.-temporary-income">Permanent vs. Temporary Income</h4>
        <p>Real expectations indicate that consumers smooth consumption over their lifetime, treating temporary income
            fluctuations differently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Consumption is related to <strong>total wealth</strong> rather than just current <span
                        class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Financial Wealth</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>)
                    includes liquid assets, and <strong>Human Wealth</strong> (<span
                        class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub><em>h</em></sub></span>) represents expected future labor
                    income: <br /><span
                        class="math display"><em>W</em> = <em>W</em><sub><em>f</em></sub> + <em>W</em><sub><em>h</em></sub></span><br />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="realistic-consumption-function">Realistic Consumption Function</h4>
        <p>A more realistic consumption function includes both current income and total wealth: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>C</em> = <em>C</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>c</em><sub>1</sub> ⋅ <em>Y</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> + <em>c</em><sub>2</sub> ⋅ <em>W</em></span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
                class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>2</sub></span> reflect the impacts of current income and wealth on
            consumption decisions, respectively.</p>
        <h3 id="investment-decision-by-firms">Investment Decision by Firms</h3>
        <h4 id="investment-function">Investment Function</h4>
        <p>Investment decisions depend on expected future cash flows from capital assets and current economic
            conditions: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>I</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>V</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>r</em>, future
                variables)</span><br /> where:</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span> = Expected present discounted value of future cash flows

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="expected-present-value-of-cash-flows">Expected Present Value of Cash Flows</h4>
        <p>The value of an investment depends on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Expected profits over the lifetime of the asset (geometric depreciation model)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Interest rates influencing the present value of future cash flows: <br /><span
                        class="math display">$$\text{Present Value} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 +
                        r)^t}$$</span><br /> where <span
                        class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>F</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> are the cash flows in year
                    <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="financial-frictions">Financial Frictions</h4>
        <p>A firm’s ability to borrow is often constrained by its current profitability, leading to the necessity of
            retaining earnings.</p>
        <h3 id="is-lm-model-with-expectations">IS-LM Model with Expectations</h3>
        <h4 id="modified-aggregate-demand">Modified Aggregate Demand</h4>
        <p>Incorporating expectations into IS-LM, aggregate demand is now a function of both current and expected future
            variables: <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>A</em><em>D</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>Y</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>Y</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>G</em>, <em>T</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>T</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>r</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>r</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>)</span><br />
            where <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>, <span
                class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>, and <span
                class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> are expected future values of income, taxes,
            and interest rates, respectively.</p>
        <h4 id="shifts-in-the-is-curve">Shifts in the IS Curve</h4>
        <p>The modified IS curve will shift more or less based on the permanence of changes in economic variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A temporary tax increase will shift IS less than a permanent tax increase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Expectations of higher future income can mitigate the impact of current tax increases.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="monetary-policy-and-expectations">Monetary Policy and Expectations</h3>
        <h4 id="central-bank-influence">Central Bank Influence</h4>
        <p>The effectiveness of monetary policy lies in managing expectations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A cut in interest rates has a greater impact when it is perceived as lasting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Expectations of low future interest rates boost consumption and investment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="counterintuitive-fiscal-policies">Counterintuitive Fiscal Policies</h4>
        <p>Fiscal contractions can lead to expansionary outcomes if they are perceived as reducing future risks or if
            they are associated with future monetary easing.</p>
        <h4 id="examples-of-expansionary-fiscal-contractions">Examples of Expansionary Fiscal Contractions</h4>
        <p>Historical cases, such as the fiscal consolidation in Ireland in the late ’80s, illustrate how positive
            expectations can result in economic growth despite short-term austerity measures.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-17">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Expectations play a critical role in shaping economic behavior, influencing investment, consumption, and
            overall aggregate demand. Understanding the expectations framework enhances the predictive power of economic
            models like the IS-LM model while showcasing the importance of managing expectations in effective monetary
            and fiscal policy.</p>
