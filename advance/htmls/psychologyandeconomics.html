        <h1>Psychology and Economics</h1>
        <h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>
        <p>This course focuses on the integration of psychological principles into economic models to understand better
            how individuals behave, especially in the context of poverty and decision making.</p>
        <h3 id="understanding-behavioral-economics">Understanding Behavioral Economics</h3>
        <p>Behavioral Economics studies the joint influence of psychological and economic factors on individual
            behaviors. The aim is to augment traditional economic models, which often rely on rigid assumptions about
            human behavior.</p>
        <h4 id="core-principles-of-standard-economics">Core Principles of Standard Economics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Stable Preferences:</strong> Individuals have well-defined and stable preferences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Rationality:</strong> Individuals behave rationally to maximize their utility function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-Interest:</strong> Primarily motivated by self-interest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-Control:</strong> Individuals possess perfect self-control to smooth consumption over
                    time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Discounting:</strong> Constant discount factor for future versus present consumption.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Risk Aversion:</strong> Individuals exhibit risk-averse behavior, characterized by a concave
                    utility function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Information Processing:</strong> Individuals update beliefs about information in a Bayesian
                    manner.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="limitations-of-standard-models">Limitations of Standard Models</h4>
        <p>Standard models often fail to predict actual behavior. Behavioral Economics seeks to identify and understand
            deviations from these models.</p>
        <h3 id="key-assumptions-and-deviations">Key Assumptions and Deviations</h3>
        <h4 id="assumption-violations">Assumption Violations</h4>
        <p>Behavioral Economics highlights real-world examples that contradict classical assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Information Bias:</strong> Individuals often hold beliefs that align with their interests
                    (confirmation bias).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Changing Preferences:</strong> Preferences may not be stable over time or context.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Limited Attention:</strong> Individuals have constraints on processing information and may
                    overlook important factors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Emotional Influences:</strong> Emotions can skew decision-making processes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Social Influences:</strong> Peer behavior can significantly impact individual choices.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="examples-of-deviations">Examples of Deviations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Limited Self-Control:</strong> Individuals may not follow through on intentions (e.g.,
                    exercise).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Miscalibration of Information Processing:</strong> Many people fail to update their beliefs
                    accurately based on new information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Peer Effects:</strong> Social norms and peer behavior influence individual choices (e.g.,
                    purchasing behaviors).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="practical-applications-policies-and-decisions">Practical Applications: Policies and Decisions</h3>
        <p>One prominent example discussed is the laptop policy in class:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Externalities:</strong> Laptop usage can distract others.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Self-Control Issues:</strong> Students may intend to focus but can easily become distracted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Policy Solutions:</strong> Ranging from laissez-faire to educational interventions or
                    restrictions.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="broad-topics-to-be-covered-in-the-course">Broad Topics to be Covered in the Course</h3>
        <ol>

        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Behavioral Economics enriches the study of economics by incorporating psychological insights and recognizes
            that human behavior often deviates from the assumptions of classical models. This course aims to explore
            those deviations and their implications in policy and individual decision-making.</p>
        <h1 id="notes-on-behavioral-economics">Notes on Behavioral Economics</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-behavioral-economics">Introduction to Behavioral Economics</h3>
        <p>Behavioral economics integrates insights from psychology into economic theory, primarily focusing on the
            cognitive, emotional, and social factors that influence individuals’ decisions.</p>
        <h4 id="survey-methodology">Survey Methodology</h4>
        <p>Surveys provide suggestive evidence about behavioral issues. Ethical considerations such as IRB approval
            depend on the anonymity and lack of personally identifiable information in surveys.</p>
        <h3 id="components-of-economic-decision-making">Components of Economic Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>Economists view human behavior through three main lenses:<br />
            1. <strong>Constrained Optimization</strong> Individuals aim to maximize their utility subject to
            constraints (e.g., budget).<br />
            <br />
            2. <strong>Utility Function</strong>

        <h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h3>
        <h4 id="exponential-discounting">Exponential Discounting</h4>
        <p>Exponential discounting is the standard model used by economists to explain how individuals value present
            versus future benefits. The utility maximization can be represented mathematically as follows:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$U = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \delta^t u_t$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> is the discount factor where <span
                        class="math inline">0 &lt; <em>δ</em> &lt; 1</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>u</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the utility received at time
                    <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This functional form implies constant discounting over time.</p>
        <h4 id="problems-with-exponential-discounting">Problems with Exponential Discounting</h4>
        <p>While exponential discounting is tractable, it does not account for certain behaviors observed in
            individuals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Inconsistencies over time (dynamic inconsistency)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Short-run impatience — tendency to favor immediate rewards over future gains.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="quasi-hyperbolic-discounting">Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting</h4>
        <p>To address the limitations of exponential discounting, the quasi-hyperbolic model introduces two parameters,
            <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$U = u_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \beta \delta^t u_t$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> reflects immediate discounting for future utilities,
                    where <span class="math inline">0 &lt; <em>β</em> &lt; 1</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> captures the long-term discounting factor.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This model allows for faster discounts of near-term utilities while treating future utilities under a
            longer-term perspective.</p>

        <h4 id="procrastination-and-education-choices">Procrastination and Education Choices</h4>
        <p>We can analyze decisions like whether to complete a problem set or pursue further education as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Immediate costs vs. future benefits (e.g., higher income due to education)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Discounting future payoff leads to procrastination when immediate costs are perceived as larger.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="examples-of-choices">Examples of Choices</h4>
        <ol>

        <h3 id="behavioral-economics-insights">Behavioral Economics Insights</h3>
        <h4 id="dynamic-consistency-vs.-time-inconsistency">Dynamic Consistency vs. Time Inconsistency</h4>
        <p>Dynamic consistency refers to maintaining preference stability over time. The assumption in the exponential
            discounting model suggests that an individual’s preferences should remain unchanged:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">If <em>A</em> ≻ <em>B</em> at time <em>t</em> ⇒ <em>A</em> ≻ <em>B</em> at
                time <em>t</em> + 1</span><br /></p>
        <p>However, evidence suggests people do not often choose the same when faced with the same option in the future,
            displaying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Preference reversals</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Demand for commitment devices (e.g., gym contracts, freezing credit cards).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="examples-of-commitment-devices">Examples of Commitment Devices</h4>
        <p>There are several ways individuals employ commitment devices, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ulysses tying himself to the mast of his ship to avoid temptation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Freezing credit cards to create barriers to impulsive spending.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusions-1">Conclusions</h3>
        <p>This lecture established the foundation for understanding time preferences and their implications on
            decision-making. The transition from exponential to quasi-hyperbolic discounting presents a more realistic
            view of human patience and impulse control.</p>

        <p>We started with a discussion of the workhorse model of classical economics, specifically the Exponential

        <h3 id="key-assumptions-of-exponential-discounting">Key Assumptions of Exponential Discounting</h3>
        <p>The key assumptions of the exponential discounting model include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Constant Discount Factor (<span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>):</strong> The weight
                    placed on future utilities remains constant across time periods. For a time period <span
                        class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, the utility is discounted as: <br /><span
                        class="math display"><em>U</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>U</em><sub>0</sub> ⋅ <em>δ</em><sup><em>t</em></sup></span><br />
                    where <span class="math inline"><em>U</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the utility at the present time.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Dynamic Consistency:</strong> Preferences will not change over time. If you plan to make a

                    factors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>No Demand for Commitment:</strong> Under traditional assumptions, individuals would not
                    restrict their future choices since more options are perceived as better.</p>

        <h3 id="evidence-against-exponential-discounting">Evidence Against Exponential Discounting</h3>
        <p>We discussed various observations that contradict the exponential discounting model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Short-term impatience: Individuals often prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones even when the

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dynamic inconsistency: Individuals often fail to follow through with future plans, appearing to

                <p>For investment goods (e.g., exercise), sophisticated individuals tend to commit early to avoid higher
                    future costs.</p>

            <li>
                <p>For leisure goods (e.g., indulging in dessert), sophisticated individuals may discourage themselves
                    from immediate consumption due to future regret, which could lead to self-sabotage because they are

        <h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The introduction of quasi-hyperbolic discounting provides a more accurate representation of human behavior in
            terms of time preferences. Understanding the dynamics of sophistication and naivete is vital for creating
            models that can predict and improve decision-making, guiding individuals toward better long-term choices.

        <h4 id="types-of-agents">Types of Agents</h4>
        <p>Three types of agents can be considered:</p>

        <h4 id="risk-aversion">Risk Aversion</h4>
        <p><strong>Risk Aversion:</strong> It refers to the tendency of individuals to prefer certainty over uncertain
            outcomes that could yield the same expected payoff. In other words, individuals are averse to taking risks.
        </p>
        <h4 id="economics-and-risk">Economics and Risk</h4>
        <p>Economics generally assumes that individuals will make choices that maximize expected utility when confronted
            with risk.</p>
        <h4 id="expected-utility-model">Expected Utility Model</h4>
        <p>The expected utility model is a foundational concept in economics to describe how individuals evaluate risky
            choices: <br /><span class="math display">$$EU = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot u(x_i)$$</span><br /> where <span
                class="math inline"><em>E</em><em>U</em></span> is the expected utility, <span
                class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the probability of outcome <span

                class="math inline"><em>u</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)</span> is the utility of outcome <span
                class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>.</p>
        <h4 id="expected-monetary-value">Expected Monetary Value</h4>
        <p>The expected monetary value (EMV) of a gamble involving two states (state 1 and state 2) is given by:
            <br /><span
                class="math display"><em>E</em><em>M</em><em>V</em> = <em>p</em> ⋅ <em>x</em> + (1 − <em>p</em>) ⋅ <em>y</em></span><br />

                class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, and <span class="math inline">1 − <em>p</em></span> is the
            probability of state 2 yielding outcome <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>.</p>
        <h3 id="measuring-risk-preferences">Measuring Risk Preferences</h3>
        <h4 id="utility-function">Utility Function</h4>
        <p>Risk preferences can be evaluated using a utility function, which translates monetary outcomes to utility
            values. A concave utility function indicates risk aversion: <br /><span
                class="math display">$$\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} &lt; 0$$</span><br /> suggesting diminishing marginal utility
            of wealth.</p>
        <h4 id="risk-aversion-coefficients">Risk Aversion Coefficients</h4>
        <p>Economists typically measure risk aversion using two coefficients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Absolute Risk Aversion (ARA):</strong> <br /><span class="math display">$$r =

        <h4 id="insurance-purchases">Insurance Purchases</h4>
        <p>Individuals often purchase insurance to mitigate risks, demonstrating risk aversion. The willingness to pay
            for insurance, despite its cost, indicates that people value reducing uncertainty.</p>
        <h4 id="choice-between-risks">Choice Between Risks</h4>
        <p>The willingness to take on risk varies with context. For instance, people may engage in gambling or lottery
            tickets despite negative expected returns, which raises questions about individual risk tolerance and
            utility perceptions.</p>

        <h4 id="discrepancies-in-risk-aversion">Discrepancies in Risk Aversion</h4>
        <p>The model struggles to reconcile small-scale risk aversion with large-scale risk choices. For example,
            rejecting a 50% chance to gain $11 against a loss of $10 suggests extreme risk aversion, leading to
            implausible conclusions about larger risks.</p>
        <h4 id="rabins-argument">Rabin’s Argument</h4>
        <p>Research by Matthew Rabin argues that consistent rejection of small-scale gambles implies unreasonable
            valuations of larger-scale gambles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline">$u(w + x) \geq \frac{1}{2}u(w + y) + \frac{1}{2}u(w - 10)$</span> suggests
                    diminishing marginal utility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Small payouts lead to large wealth implications, hence failing to fit observed behaviors.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="conclusion-4">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The expected utility model provides a framework for understanding risk preferences but fails to adequately
            explain discrepancies in small versus large-scale risk choices. Future discussions will delve into
            alternative models that account for these anomalies.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This lecture focuses on economic behavior under conditions of uncertainty and risk, particularly through the
            lens of the expected utility model.</p>
        <h3 id="expected-utility-theory">Expected Utility Theory</h3>
        <p>The expected utility (EU) model is a powerful tool used by economists to evaluate choices made under
            uncertainty. It is defined as:</p>
        <p><br /><span
                class="math display"><em>U</em>(<em>E</em>) = ∑<em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>U</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)</span><br />
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>E</em>)</span> is the utility of the expected value,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the probability of outcome <span
                        class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)</span> is the utility
                    associated with outcome <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Expected utility theory assists in understanding behaviors, such as investment decisions where higher risk
            typically demands higher expected returns.</p>
        <h4 id="applications">Applications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Investment: Investments with increased volatility necessitate a higher return.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Crime: As the likelihood of getting caught increases, criminal behavior decreases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Insurance Choices: Individuals may prefer lower deductibles despite higher premiums due to perceived
                    risks.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="evaluating-risk-preferences">Evaluating Risk Preferences</h3>
        <p>Risk preferences are typically represented by a parameter <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> known
            as the risk aversion coefficient. The model used frequently for estimating utility preferences is the
            Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$U(W) = \frac{W^{1 - \gamma}}{1 - \gamma}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>Where <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> is wealth, and <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span>
            represents the risk aversion level. Estimation of <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> can be derived
            from individuals’ choices in risky situations through the concept of revealed preference.</p>
        <h4 id="contrasting-risk-aversion">Contrasting Risk Aversion</h4>
        <p>Evidence showed that individuals exhibit varying degrees of risk aversion based on the scale of the gamble:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Small-scale gambles yield high <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> (e.g., between 10-30).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Large-scale gambles yield moderate <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> (e.g., between 0-2).
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This contradiction poses a challenge: fitting a single <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> to account
            for both small- and large-scale gambles is not feasible.</p>
        <h3 id="matthew-rabins-calibration-theorem">Matthew Rabin’s Calibration Theorem</h3>
        <p>This theorem illustrates how declining small-scale gambles with positive expected value implies irrational
            choices in larger gambles.</p>
        <h3 id="empirical-analysis-insurance-choices">Empirical Analysis: Insurance Choices</h3>
        <p>Justin Sydnor’s research utilized data from 50,000 home insurance policies, focusing on deductible choices to
            ascertain risk preferences. Key points include:</p>
        <h4 id="deductibles-and-premiums">Deductibles and Premiums</h4>
        <p>A deductible is an out-of-pocket expense paid by a policyholder before reimbursement by the insurer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Choosing a lower deductible means increased premium costs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Policyholders often favor lower deductibles despite higher premiums.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="claim-rate-insights">Claim Rate Insights</h4>
        <p>The average yearly claim rate associated with chosen deductibles is under 5%, suggesting that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>People are willing to pay more for lower deductibles despite low likelihoods of claim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This behavior indicates high risk aversion which is hard to reconcile with lower estimates in
                    large-scale risks.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="implied-risk-aversion">Implied Risk Aversion</h4>
        <p>From Sydnor’s analysis, estimated <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> values ranged significantly,

        <h3 id="kahneman-and-tverskys-prospect-theory">Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory</h3>
        <p>Kahneman and Tversky proposed an alternative model, focusing on how people make decisions based on potential

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Reference-Dependent Utility:</strong> Utility is derived from changes relative to a reference
                    point (denoted <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>), not absolute levels of consumption
                    (denoted <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>). <br /><span

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Loss Aversion:</strong> Losses have a greater impact on utility than equivalent gains. For
                    instance, losing $100 feels worse than gaining $100 feels good. This is visually represented in the
                    value function, which is flatter in the gain domain and steeper in the loss domain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Diminishing Sensitivity:</strong> The value function exhibits diminishing sensitivity. The
                    perceived change in utility decreases as the value moves further from the reference point.

        <h3 id="introduction-4">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This lecture is focused on social preferences, providing a more uplifting examination compared to previous
            lectures. The discussion will address the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Social preferences in the workplace</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The impact of pay inequality on productivity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The influence of policies on pro-sociality</p>

        <h4 id="relative-pay-and-productivity">Relative Pay and Productivity</h4>
        <p>Bandiera et al. conducted a study on fruit farms in the UK, focusing on the effects of relative pay on
            productivity. The study distinguished between:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Piece rates (payment per unit of output)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Relative pay (payment based on productivity compared to that of others)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="findings">Findings</h5>
        <p>The introduction of relative pay led to unexpected productivity outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Workers displayed a strong increase in productivity when compensated with piece rates, showing a
                    better than 50% increase compared to relative pay schemes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Under relative pay schemes, productivity stagnated at about 5 kilograms per hour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The study highlighted that reduced effort among workers might stem from social preferences; when
                    workers anticipate that high effort may disadvantage their peers, they may reduce their output
                    voluntarily.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="morale-effects-of-pay-inequality">Morale Effects of Pay Inequality</h4>
        <p>Breza et al. examined low-skill manufacturing workers in rural India to explore how perceived pay inequality
            affects morale and productivity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Workers expressed reduced cooperation and performance when they perceived unfair pay disparities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Even high-wage workers exhibited lower productivity when surrounded by lower-wage colleagues compared
                    to a compressed wage group.</p>

        <h4 id="the-contact-hypothesis">The Contact Hypothesis</h4>
        <p>This hypothesis posits that exposing individuals to diverse groups can reduce prejudice and increase
            pro-social behavior. This was illustrated through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Gautam Rao’s study involving rich and poor children in Delhi, which found increased generosity among
                    rich students exposed to their poorer peers.</p>

        <h5 id="roommate-interactions">Roommate Interactions</h5>
        <p>Corno et al. explored the impact of interracial interactions among college roommates in South Africa, leading
            to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Reduced stereotypes and improved friendships among races.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enhanced academic performance and lower dropout rates among disadvantaged groups.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="underestimating-the-benefits-of-pro-sociality">Underestimating the Benefits of Pro-Sociality</h3>
        <p>Kumar and Epley’s research highlighted how people might underestimate the positive impact of being generous:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When predicting others’ reactions to acts of kindness (e.g., gratitude letters), individuals often
                    assume negative feedback where none exists.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="findings-1">Findings</h5>
        <p>Key results indicated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Participants generally underestimated the positive reaction receivers would have towards their
                    gratitude letters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The research showed that the acts of kindness led to greater happiness in recipients than
                    anticipated.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-10">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>These findings suggest significant implications for understanding social preferences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Social preferences are deeply rooted in individual interactions and can be manipulated through
                    exposure to diverse groups.</p>

        <h1 id="lecture-notes-attention-in-behavioral-economics">Lecture Notes: Attention in Behavioral Economics</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-5">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we explore the concept of attention in the context of decision-making within the framework
            of behavioral economics. We start with a review of preferences discussed in previous lectures, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Time preferences</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Risk preferences</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Social preferences</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In particular, we focus on how individuals make decisions based on their environment, information, and
            learning mechanisms.</p>
        <h3 id="attention-and-decision-making">Attention and Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>Attention plays a fundamental role in how people gather information and make choices. Critical questions
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>How do we decide what to attend to?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What factors influence our learning from new information?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="change-blindness">Change Blindness</h4>
        <p>We introduce the concept of <strong>change blindness</strong>, where individuals fail to notice significant
            changes in their environment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Example: Participants often miss a change in a bank teller when distracted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The gorilla experiment illustrates how focusing on specific tasks (e.g., counting passes) can lead to
                    missing obvious stimuli (e.g., a gorilla walking through the scene).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="dichotic-listening-experiments">Dichotic Listening Experiments</h4>
        <p>The study of dichotic listening experiments from 1958 demonstrates that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Individuals can effectively focus on one auditory channel but often fail to recall information from
                    the unattended channel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Attention is limited, which impacts memory retention.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="factors-affecting-attention">Factors Affecting Attention</h3>
        <p>Several factors can affect an individual’s attention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Physical environment (noise, temperature).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Distractions including social media and outside worries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Social status, which can influence logics of attention and response.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sleep deprivation and general stress levels.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="rational-inattention-models">Rational Inattention Models</h3>
        <p>Across many contexts, rational inattention models suggest that individuals may neglect important information
            due to limited attention resources. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the costs of inattention exceed the benefits, individuals will adjust their focus accordingly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There exists a conceptual paradox where critical information is often overlooked, leading to
                    potential welfare losses.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="chetty-et-al.-on-inattention-to-taxes">Chetty et al. on Inattention to Taxes</h4>
        <p>The research by Raj Chetty and colleagues investigates consumer inattention regarding sales taxes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Sales taxes are perceived through price tags at points of purchase, which may not register until
                    checkout.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Data from grocery stores shows significant disparities in demand when making taxes salient versus
                    non-salient.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The perceived value of a good, <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span>, can be decomposed into:
            <br /><span class="math display"><em>V</em> = <em>v</em> + <em>o</em></span><br /> where <span
                class="math inline"><em>v</em></span> is the visible/salient component and <span
                class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> is the opaque/invisible component.</p>
        <p>For inattentive consumers, the perceived value, <span class="math inline"><em>V̂</em></span>, is given by:
            <br /><span class="math display"><em>V̂</em> = <em>v</em> + (1 − <em>θ</em>)<em>o</em></span><br /> where
            <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> measures the degree of attention to the opaque component.</p>
        <h5 id="demand-response-to-taxes">Demand Response to Taxes</h5>
        <p>Chetty et al. analyzed how demand for goods responds when sales tax information is rendered evident. Their
            findings support that: <br /><span class="math display">$$\Delta \log D = \frac{\theta \cdot
                t_p}{\eta}$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> is demand, <span
                class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> is the sales tax, and <span
                class="math inline"><em>η</em></span> is price elasticity. The estimated degree of inattention (<span
                class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>) is significant as it quantifies how consumers respond to the
            introduction of sales taxes.</p>
        <h3 id="proving-inattention">Proving Inattention</h3>
        <p>To demonstrate the impact of inattention, Chetty et al. utilized a controlled experiment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>By highlighting the sales tax on price tags, they gauged the consumer response.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The difference-in-differences estimator was used to compare treated groups with control groups.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The findings indicated that consumers are considerably inattentive regarding sales taxes compared to visible
            price changes.</p>
        <h3 id="learning-by-noticing-schwartzstein-model">Learning by Noticing: Schwartzstein Model</h3>
        <p>Building on the concept of rational inattention, Schwartzstein’s model illustrates how beliefs affect
            attention:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If consumers lack a relevant theory about a product, they may not pay attention to important
                    information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Case Study: Seaweed farmers in Indonesia failed to recognize pod size as a factor affecting yield,
                    ultimately leading to suboptimal farming practices.</p>

        <h3 id="conclusion-11">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The lecture integrates the evidence supporting the systematic existence of inattention in decision-making,
            with a focus on taxes, consumer behavior, and learning failures. Understanding inattention can provide

        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we discuss the concept of utility derived from beliefs, also addressing the implications of
            attention and systematic deviations from optimal belief formation and information acquisition.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Utility from Beliefs:</strong> People derive direct utility from their beliefs about
                    themselves, the world, and future events.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Anticipatory Utility:</strong> Utility can stem from looking forward to future positive
                    events or outcomes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Ego Utility:</strong> Individuals derive utility from thinking positively about themselves
                    (e.g., intelligence or appearance).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="attention-and-information-acquisition">Attention and Information Acquisition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Attention is limited; individuals may miss critical information due to inattention or beliefs about
                    what is important.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Example: Many people underestimate taxes in purchases because they do not see total costs clearly.
                </p>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="systematic-deviations-in-beliefs">Systematic Deviations in Beliefs</h4>
        <p>People may:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Misinterpret the importance of certain information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Suffer from cognitive biases leading to incorrect beliefs.</p>

        </ol>
        <h3 id="utility-functions-traditional-vs.-beliefs">Utility Functions: Traditional vs. Beliefs</h3>
        <p>Economists typically define utility functions over tangible outcomes (money, health, etc.). However, utility
            can also come from beliefs about these outcomes:</p>

            <li>
                <p>Willingness to pay to avoid an electric shock was highest when it was immediate, indicating a desire

        <h3 id="conclusion-12">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The concept of utility from beliefs plays a critical role in understanding how people make decisions
            regarding future outcomes and the information they choose to acquire. Individuals may intentionally avoid
            information that could lead to negative anticipatory utility, impacting their health and happiness over
            time.</p>
        <h1 id="lecture-notes-anticipatory-utility-and-information-acquisition">Lecture Notes: Anticipatory Utility and
            Information Acquisition</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-6">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we discussed anticipatory utility, which is the utility derived from beliefs about future
            events and how these beliefs influence consumer behavior, particularly in terms of consumption timing and
            information acquisition.</p>
        <h3 id="anticipatory-utility-1">Anticipatory Utility</h3>
        <h4 id="utility-from-beliefs">Utility from Beliefs</h4>
        <p>Anticipatory utility affects how individuals choose to engage in activities based on their expectations of
            future outcomes, providing a motivation to pursue positively anticipated events.</p>
        <h4 id="information-acquisition">Information Acquisition</h4>
        <p>When individuals derive utility from beliefs, it affects their motivation to seek or avoid information,
            particularly negative information. For example, individuals at risk of Huntington’s disease may avoid
            testing due to the fear of confirming a negative diagnosis, thereby maintaining a facade of health.</p>
        <h3 id="modeling-information-and-beliefs">Modeling Information and Beliefs</h3>
        <p>We discussed a simple model where individuals have a constraint to maintain accurate beliefs about
            information received. The key conditions for individuals wanting to gather information are summarized in the
            following utility function:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>p</em>)</span><br /></p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>p</em>)</span> represents the utility derived from beliefs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is concave, individuals are information-averse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is convex, individuals are information-loving.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The decision to gather information relies on the character of <span
                class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>p</em>)</span>.</p>
        <h4 id="manipulating-beliefs">Manipulating Beliefs</h4>
        <p>If individuals can manipulate beliefs, they might favor believing they have a higher probability (<span
                class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 1</span>) of being healthy, especially if no consequences exist for
            self-deception.</p>
        <h3 id="overoptimism-and-decision-making">Overoptimism and Decision Making</h3>
        <p>Overoptimism about future events may lead to higher momentary utility but may distort decision-making
            adversely in the long run.</p>
        <h4 id="empirical-evidence-1">Empirical Evidence</h4>
        <p>Research shows that individuals often believe they are less likely to face negative outcomes (e.g., health
            issues, divorce) compared to average populations. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>99% of drivers consider themselves better than average drivers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Small business owners overestimate their chances of success.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Smokers acknowledge health risks but remain unconvinced it applies to them.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="understanding-biases-in-probability-judgments">Understanding Biases in Probability Judgments</h3>
        <h4 id="heuristics-and-biases-overview">Heuristics and Biases Overview</h4>
        <p>Kahneman and Tversky’s work has established that individuals employ heuristics, or shortcuts, to simplify
            complex decision-making processes. This leads to systematic biases:</p>
        <h4 id="examples-of-heuristics">Examples of Heuristics</h4>
        <p><strong>1. Representativeness Heuristic:</strong> Individuals tend to judge probabilities by how much they
            resemble existing prototypes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Example: Participants believed it more probable that Linda is a bank teller and a feminist (Statement
                    8) rather than just a bank teller (Statement 6), despite the logic suggesting otherwise.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2. Availability Heuristic:</strong> The probability judgment of an event is influenced by how easily
            instances can be recalled from memory.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Example: People overestimate the frequency of homicide compared to suicide based on recent media
                    exposure.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>3. Base Rate Neglect:</strong> Individuals often ignore the base rate information when making
            probability judgments, focusing instead on specific information such as test accuracy or event descriptions.
            <br /><span class="math display">$$P(H | T) = \frac{P(T | H) P(H)}{P(T)}$$</span><br /> Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em>|<em>T</em>)</span> is the probability of having a
                    condition given a positive test result.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>T</em>|<em>H</em>)</span> is the probability of a positive
                    test result when conditioned on actually having the disease.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em>)</span> is the base rate of the disease within the
                    population.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="conclusion-and-implications">Conclusion and Implications</h4>
        <p>Understanding these biases and heuristics can inform better decision-making strategies in various fields by
            emphasizing the importance of accurate information dissemination and how to counteract biases effectively.

        <p><strong>Study by Bertrand et al.</strong>: The authors argue there exists a norm where men perceive that they

        <p>Child penalties appear to be transmitted through generations, suggesting that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Daughters whose mothers experience child penalties are likely to encounter similar penalties later in

        <h4 id="study-by-bursztyn-et-al.">Study by Bursztyn et al.</h4>
        <p>The study investigates whether women avoid career-enhancing actions due to potential negative perceptions in

                <p>Unmarried female MBA students perform similar to their married counterparts when performance is

            <li>
                <p>However, their participation rates are lower, especially in visible settings.</p>
            </li>

        <p><strong>Vesterlund Study</strong>: This study analyzes the distribution of tasks assigned to men and women,

            preferences. We begin with a review of the impact of defaults, nudges, and framing effects on decision
            making.</p>
        <h3 id="defaults-and-framing-effects">Defaults and Framing Effects</h3>
        <h4 id="default-effects">Default Effects</h4>
        <p>Definition: A default option is the choice that is automatically selected if no alternative is chosen by the
            individual.<br />
            <br />
            Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Retirement Savings: Setting a default savings rate in retirement accounts can greatly influence
                    savings behavior as many individuals opt for the default rather than actively choosing an
                    alternative.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Organ Donation: Countries with presumed consent (opt-out) for organ donation have significantly
                    higher donation rates compared to countries that require explicit consent (opt-in).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="choice-architecture">Choice Architecture</h4>
        <p>Nudge Theory: According to Thaler and Sunstein, a <em>nudge</em> can steer individuals’ choices without
            removing their freedom of choice.<br />
            <br />
            Key Components of Nudges:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Simplification of choices</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Information disclosure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use of social norms (e.g., feedback about energy consumption relative to neighbors)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="active-choice-vs.-default">Active Choice vs. Default</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Active Choice: Individuals are encouraged to make a decision explicitly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Implications: Active choice is most effective when preferences are diverse, while default choices can
                    be beneficial when individuals lack knowledge, allowing them to make better decisions without
                    coercion.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="key-research-examples">Key Research Examples</h3>
        <h4 id="flu-shot-scheduling-experiment">Flu Shot Scheduling Experiment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Design: Two treatment groups received encouragement to make a plan for receiving a flu shot (date
                    plan and time plan).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Results: Increased uptake rates from control (33%) to treatment (37%).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="fafsa-assistance-study">FAFSA Assistance Study</h4>
        <p>Research by Bettinger et al. showed that providing assistance in completing FAFSA applications significantly
            increased college enrollment.</p>

        <h4 id="malleability-of-preferences">Malleability of Preferences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Psychological research indicates that individuals often lack awareness of the origins of their
                    preferences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Nisbett and Wilson’s Findings: People often make up reasons for their preferences post hoc, failing
                    to recognize the influence of external factors.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="examples-of-cognitive-biases">Examples of Cognitive Biases</h4>
        <p>1. Two-String Problem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Subjects fail to solve the problem until an external cue (motion of the cords) is introduced, leading
                    to the epiphany of how to use them.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Bystander Effect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Individuals are less likely to help others in an emergency when others are present, misattributing
                    their inaction to personal beliefs about the situation.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3. Position Effect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Individuals select items based on their position in a lineup, but fail to acknowledge that this
                    positioning influenced their choice.</p>
            </li>

        <h4 id="coherent-arbitrariness-concept">Coherent Arbitrariness Concept</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>People construct preferences and values dynamically, based on cues and context.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Anchoring: Initial values can disproportionately influence subsequent estimates of willingness to pay
                    (WTP).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="becker-degroot-marschak-bdm-procedure">Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) Procedure</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Purpose: Elicit true preferences for goods without the influence of bargaining strategies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Method: Present a random price; if the bid exceeds this price, the individual buys the item.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensures incentive compatibility.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Two groups were presented with the same poetry reading but framed differently: as a paid activity vs.
                    a cost to endure. Outcomes showed significant differences in WTP based on framing.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-15">Conclusion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Preferences are not stable; they are influenced by external factors, which can be strategically
                    manipulated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Understanding how preferences are constructed can inform policy design and intervention strategies
                    aimed at improving decision-making in various domains.</p>

        <h4 id="the-concept-of-scarcity">The Concept of Scarcity</h4>
        <p>Scarcity is defined as not having enough of something, leading to limited cognitive capacity. This can
            manifest in: <br /><span class="math display">Cognitive Capacity = Total Cognitive Resources − Cognitive
                Load from Scarcity</span><br /> When thoughts about money dominate, they leave less cognitive bandwidth
            for other tasks.</p>
        <h4 id="evidence-of-cognitive-effects-of-poverty">Evidence of Cognitive Effects of Poverty</h4>
        <p>Two main studies were highlighted:</p>

        <h3 id="rationality-and-revealed-preferences">Rationality and Revealed Preferences</h3>
        <p>Rationality in economics involves the idea that beliefs, preferences, and actions are consistent. An
            individual’s choices can reveal their underlying preferences.<br />
            <strong>Key Definition:</strong> If a person behaves in a certain way, it must be that their preferences can
            rationalize that behavior.
        </p>
        <h4 id="utility-and-choice">Utility and Choice</h4>
        <p>Utility can be thought of as the satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming goods or services. In
            classical economics, it is assumed that individuals seek to maximize their utility.</p>
        <h3 id="measuring-happiness">Measuring Happiness</h3>
        <p>Measuring happiness can be complex due to the differing ways in which it can be experienced over time.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Cultural Differences: Responses to happiness surveys can vary significantly across cultures,
                    impacting how happiness is measured.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Income: Broadly, richer individuals report higher happiness; however, baseline sufficiency seems to
                    settle around an income level.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Social Relationships: Maintaining strong social connections is one of the most consistent predictors

        <h3 id="policy-implications-1">Policy Implications</h3>
        <p>As we consider interventions or policies to enhance well-being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Understanding human biases and limitations in decision-making is essential.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Policymakers should consider implementing programs that improve access to mental health resources.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Incorporating measures of subjective well-being can inform more holistic policy-oriented approaches.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="concluding-notes">Concluding Notes</h3>
        <p>In future lectures, discussions on actual implementations of policies aimed at improving mental health will
            take place.</p>
        <p>Consider engaging with your own happiness practices: reflect on the social ties you nurture, the balance
            between work and life satisfaction, and the active choices you make towards your well-being.</p>

        <p>This lecture focuses on paternalism, examining its definitions, motivations, and implications when applied to
            governmental policies that influence behavioral agents.</p>
        <h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
        <h4 id="paternalism">Paternalism</h4>
        <p>Paternalism is defined as <em>“An attempt to influence or control people’s conduct for their own good.”</em>
            It assumes individuals may not be fully optimizing their decisions, particularly impacting themselves.</p>
        <h4 id="internalities">Internalities</h4>
        <p>Internalities refer to the effects individuals impose on their future selves, often leading to decisions that
            are not in their long-term best interest.</p>
