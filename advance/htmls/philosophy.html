        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The lecture discusses Glaucon’s challenge in Plato’s work, particularly relating to the motivations for moral behavior, as illustrated through the story of the Ring of Gyges. The exploration also includes perspectives from contemporary psychology, particularly Daniel Batson’s research.</p>
        <h3 id="platos-influence">Plato’s Influence</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Plato (c. 427–347 BCE) is a foundational figure in Western philosophy.</p></li>
        <li><p>Born into an aristocratic family in Athens; expected to pursue politics or civic leadership.</p></li>
        <li><p>Became a student of Socrates, who influenced his philosophical outlook.</p></li>
        <li><p>After Socrates’ death in 399 BCE, Plato founded the Academy (c. 385 BCE), one of the first institutions of higher learning in the Western world.</p></li>
        <li><p>Key works include <em>The Republic</em>, where Plato examines justice, the ideal state, and morality.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-ring-of-gyges">The Ring of Gyges</h3>
        <h4 id="glaucons-challenge">Glaucon’s Challenge</h4>
        <p>Glaucon, Plato’s brother, presents several questions concerning justice:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Nature and origin of justice.</p></li>
        <li><p>The claim that people act justly unwillingly—primarily for reputation or reward.</p></li>
        <li><p>The assertion that they are right to do so.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="seeming-vs.-being">Seeming vs. Being</h4>
        <p>Key contrasts are drawn:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Seeming vs. Being:</strong> The distinction between appearances and reality is crucial in philosophical discussions concerning morality.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Values:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><em>Intrinsic Value</em>: Things valued for their own sake (e.g., joy, pleasure).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Instrumental Value</em>: Things valued for what they can bring us (e.g., money).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Both</em>: Certain things can have both intrinsic and instrumental value (e.g., knowledge).</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="glaucons-stories">Glaucon’s Stories</h3>
        <p>Glaucon uses hypothetical scenarios to test moral motivations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Ring of Gyges:</strong> If one could act unjustly without consequence, they would do so.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Inversion Scenario:</strong> If a just person is seen as unjust and vice versa, would they still choose to act justly?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="consequences-of-actions">Consequences of Actions</h3>
        <p>This leads to the question of whether morality is merely like taking medicine (a means to an end) or if it holds intrinsic worth. The challenge posed asks:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Is acting morally about the outcome (reputation) or about the act itself?</p>

        <h3 id="daniel-batsons-research">Daniel Batson’s Research</h3>
        <h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
        <p>Daniel Batson explores moral integrity and hypocrisy through experimental psychology. He examines whether people’s intentions are to be moral or merely to appear moral.</p>
        <h4 id="experimental-design">Experimental Design</h4>
        <p>Participants make assignments between two tasks:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A fun task that rewards them (lottery tickets).</p></li>
        <li><p>A dull task that does not reward them.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>In a condition without direct observation, 80% of subjects assign themselves to the beneficial task but self-rate their moral integrity only moderately (4 out of 9).</p></li>
        <li><p>When given a coin flip opportunity, 90% assigned themselves to the beneficial task, rating themselves highly (7 out of 9).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="the-role-of-self-observation">The Role of Self-Observation</h4>
        <p>Batson’s research indicates that self-awareness affects moral behavior:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Presence of a mirror decreases selfish behavior dramatically.</p></li>
        <li><p>People act more fairly when they feel observed, demonstrating a social dimension to morality.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        <p>The contrasts drawn between intrinsic and instrumental value of justice and the implications of Glaucon’s scenarios echo throughout both ancient and contemporary examinations of moral behavior. The discussion raises difficult questions about human motivations and societal structures conducive to moral actions.</p>
        <h3 id="questions-for-consideration">Questions for Consideration</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>What are the implications of acting morally only when observed?</p></li>
        <li><p>How can society structure incentives to promote genuine moral behavior?</p></li>

        <h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This lecture focused on the importance of sampling methods in psychological research, highlighting the concept of <strong>sampling bias</strong>. It discussed Plato’s and Aristotle’s approaches to drawing conclusions about human nature and introduced the psychological concept of <strong>dual processing theory</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="sampling-bias-in-psychological-research">Sampling Bias in Psychological Research</h3>
        <h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
        <p>Sampling bias occurs when the sample selected for research does not accurately represent the larger population from which it was drawn. This can lead to erroneous conclusions about human behaviors and traits.</p>
        <h4 id="example-of-sampling-bias">Example of Sampling Bias</h4>
        <p>In a recent poll by the professor regarding the percentage of students in class who have clickers, it was illustrated that the poll only captured the preferences of those with clickers: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Result} = \frac{\text{Number ofClicker Users}}{\text{Total Respondents}} \times 100\% = 97\%$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>However, this does not accurately represent the entire class, which may include non-clicker users.</p>
        <h4 id="weird-populations">WEIRD Populations</h4>
        <p>The acronym <strong>WEIRD</strong> stands for <em>Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic</em>. Many psychological studies base their findings on this limited demographic, which may not generalize to other cultural contexts.</p>
        <h3 id="dual-processing-theory">Dual Processing Theory</h3>
        <h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4>
        <p>The dual processing theory posits that there are two systems through which humans process information:</p>

        <li><p><strong>System 1</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Fast, automatic, and unconscious.</p></li>

        <p>The lecture begins with a discussion on internet precommitment among students in a classroom. The decision-making process regarding internet use during class is considered a reflection of self-regulation.</p>
        <h4 id="polling-on-internet-use">Polling on Internet Use</h4>
        <p>Students were asked to respond to their internet usage commitments through a clicker question:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Press 1: Completely turning off the internet</p></li>
        <li><p>Press 2: Restricting usage in some way</p></li>
        <li><p>Press 3: No restrictions</p></li>
        <li><p>Press 4: Not applicable (using pencil and paper)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The results showed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>43% made a precommitment (written promise).</p></li>
        <li><p>16% attempted some restriction.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="commitment-and-self-regulation">Commitment and Self-Regulation</h3>
        <p>The discussion shifted to how self-regulation is often insufficient, leading to strategies for external constraints to help maintain commitments. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Phone Condom</strong>: A physical barrier to device access.</p></li>
        <li><p>Software solutions that restrict internet access.</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="philosophical-frameworks-1">Philosophical Frameworks</h3>
        <p>The lecture explores philosophical arguments from Plato and Aristotle designed to provide a framework for understanding self-regulation.</p>
        <h4 id="platos-tripartite-soul-1">Plato’s Tripartite Soul</h4>
        <p>Plato’s concept suggests that the soul consists of three parts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Rational (reason)</p></li>
        <li><p>Spirited (emotion, honor)</p></li>
        <li><p>Appetitive (desire, appetite)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plato argues that a harmonious soul achieves happiness. He implies that:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"One is just who does not allow the various parts within him to meddle with each other."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="four-cardinal-virtues">Four Cardinal Virtues</h4>
        <p>Plato outlines four cardinal virtues corresponding to the soul and society:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Wisdom</strong> (Rational)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Courage</strong> (Spirited)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Moderation</strong> (Appetitive)</p></li>

        <h3 id="glaucon-vs.-socrates-on-justice">Glaucon vs. Socrates on Justice</h3>
        <p>Glaucon presents a materialistic view of justice, while Socrates defends justice with intrinsic value:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Justice = health of the soul, analogous to health in the body.</p></li>
        <li><p>Argument: <em>Justice is a form of well-being.</em></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="happiness-in-the-context-of-justice">Happiness in the Context of Justice</h4>
        <p>Plato argues that true happiness comes from a well-ordered soul: <br /><span class="math display">Happiness = Pleasure from acting justly</span><br /></p>
        <p>Socrates compares unjust acquisition of wealth to enslaving one’s soul, emphasizing the value of spiritual well-being over material gains.</p>
        <h3 id="jonathan-haidts-modern-perspective">Jonathan Haidt’s Modern Perspective</h3>
        <p>Haidt builds on these ideas in contemporary psychology, emphasizing:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Clickers will be used in the second part of the lecture.</p>
        <h3 id="aristotles-views-on-happiness">Aristotle’s Views on Happiness</h3>
        <p>The ancient Greek idea central to this discussion is <strong>eudaimonia</strong>, which can be understood as human flourishing or thriving. According to Aristotle, achieving eudaimonia requires a harmonious soul composed of three parts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Reason</strong> (rationality)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Spirit</strong> (emotions concerned with honor)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Appetite</strong> (desires for consumption and procreation)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The individual who flourishes aligns instinctive appetites and emotions with their rational reflective commitments.</p>
        <h4 id="aristotles-formula-for-cultivating-virtue">Aristotle’s Formula for Cultivating Virtue</h4>
        <p>Aristotle asserts that there is one ultimate end that we pursue for its own sake, which is eudaimonia. He emphasizes that true happiness comes from the expression of rational capacities rather than mere satisfaction of appetites or emotions.</p>
        <p>The special function of humans, according to Aristotle, is the expression of reason: <br /><span class="math display">Human Good = Activity of the Soul that Expresses Reason</span><br /></p>
        <h6 id="virtue">Virtue</h6>
        <p>Aristotle defines virtue as:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Instinctive responses that align with rational commitments.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="types-of-virtues">Types of Virtues</h3>
        <p>Aristotle distinguishes between:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Virtues of Thought:</strong> Gained through pedagogical instruction (e.g., knowing facts).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Virtues of Character:</strong> Developed through habitual actions and practices.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="virtues-of-character">Virtues of Character</h4>
        <p>Aristotle argues that virtues of character arise <em>neither by nature nor against nature</em>, but can be cultivated through habit.</p>
        <h6 id="habituation-process">Habituation Process</h6>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>We learn to do things by doing them.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For instance, one becomes a builder through building, or a musician through practicing their instrument.</p>
        <h4 id="the-danger-of-habitual-actions">The Danger of Habitual Actions</h4>
        <p>Aristotle notes:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Whatever it is that you practice doing will become habitual to you.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Good habits need to be emphasized, and bad habits need to be avoided, as both can instill themselves equally through practice.</p>
        <h3 id="the-aristotelian-mean">The Aristotelian Mean</h3>
        <p>Aristotle advocates for a balance, or <em>mean</em>, which lies between the extremes of deficiency and excess in behaviors:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Bravery</strong> lies between cowardice and recklessness.</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="the-virtuous-circle-of-habit">The Virtuous Circle of Habit</h4>
        <p>Aristotle articulates a cycle of cultivating virtue:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>"Abstaining from pleasures makes us become temperate."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once one becomes temperate, they are further aided in abstaining from pleasures.</p>
        <h3 id="disordered-soul-and-moral-injuries">Disordered Soul and Moral Injuries</h3>
        <p>This portion of the lecture discusses the implications of having a disordered soul, relating to moral injuries experienced by soldiers as articulated by Jonathan Shay and contrasting these with thematic elements from Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>.</p>
        <h4 id="moral-injuries">Moral Injuries</h4>
        <p>These arise when the moral structure of an individual or community is compromised, leading to lasting psychological effects similar to PTSD for soldiers.</p>
        <h4 id="key-quotes-from-shay">Key Quotes from Shay</h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>“Only this bitterness eats at my heart when one man has deprived and shamed his equal, taking back his prize by abuse of power.”</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This parallels the experience of many soldiers who feel a sense of injustice and betrayal from their leaders.</p>
        <h4 id="shays-thesis">Shay’s Thesis</h4>
        <p>Shay posits:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Injuries inflicted are not purely physical but moral.</p></li>
        <li><p>The legitimacy of moral order is pivotal in maintaining psychological well-being and community cohesion.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-4">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The discussion surrounding Aristotle’s views introduces crucial questions about the nature of virtue, the process of moral cultivation, and the ramifications of a disordered soul. The principles discussed serve as a foundation for understanding human behavior in both philosophical and practical contexts.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-4">Introduction</h3>
        <p>These notes summarize a lecture discussing the psychological implications of obedience in the Milgram study and its relation to the human experience of morality, attachment, and flourishing.</p>
        <h3 id="the-milgram-experiment">The Milgram Experiment</h3>
        <h4 id="context-and-purpose">Context and Purpose</h4>
        <p>In the context of Jonathan Shay’s work, particularly regarding the psychological costs of acting immorally, the lecture focused on the Milgram Experiment conducted at Yale University. This experiment aimed to understand the extent of obedience to authority and how ordinary individuals could engage in behavior that causes harm to others.</p>
        <h4 id="advertisement-and-recruitment">Advertisement and Recruitment</h4>
        <p>In 1961, an advertisement was published:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Public announcement. We will pay you $4 for one hour of your time... We need you only for that one hour. No special training, education, or experience was needed.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Participants were invited to a laboratory setting located in Linsley-Chittenden Hall, where they were told they would participate in a study of learning and memory.</p>
        <h4 id="experimental-design-1">Experimental Design</h4>
        <p>Participants were assigned the role of "teacher" and instructed to administer electric shocks to a "learner" for incorrect answers. The shock levels were as follows:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Slight Shock (15V)</p></li>
        <li><p>Moderate Shock (30V)</p></li>
        <li><p>Strong Shock (45V)</p></li>
        <li><p>Intense Shocks (Up to 450V)</p></li>
        <li><p>Danger Severe Shock (Usually at 300V)</p></li>
        <li><p>XXX (Maximum 450V)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Interestingly, all participants (100%) administered shocks at lower levels, while 65% proceeded to the highest shock level.</p>
        <h4 id="predictions-vs.-outcomes">Predictions vs. Outcomes</h4>
        <p>Before the experiment, Yale psychology majors predicted that only 3% would deliver the highest shocks. Contrary to these predictions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>100% administered minimal shocks.</p></li>
        <li><p>88% delivered intense shocks.</p></li>
        <li><p>68% continued when prompted by the authority figure.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Milgram’s findings drew attention to human behavior in extreme situations, particularly in the context of historical events, such as Nazi obedience.</p>
        <h4 id="psychological-impact-on-subjects">Psychological Impact on Subjects</h4>
        <p>Participants displayed significant emotional distress, including sweating, stuttering, and expressions of anxiety. One participant described as a businessman became visibly agitated yet continued with the procedure.</p>
        <h4 id="compliance-variables">Compliance Variables</h4>
        <p>Milgram explored factors affecting compliance:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Proximity of the experimenter (e.g., being in the same room vs. on the phone).</p></li>
        <li><p>Feedback from the learner (e.g., no feedback vs. voice feedback vs. physical presence).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>He found that compliance decreases as personal interaction with the victim increases.</p>
        <h3 id="flourishing-and-attachment-theory">Flourishing and Attachment Theory</h3>
        <h4 id="human-nature-and-social-bonds">Human Nature and Social Bonds</h4>
        <p>Human beings are inherently social creatures, as demonstrated through studies by Harry Harlow on attachment and nurturing in primates. Harlow’s cloth vs. wire mother experiment showed that emotional support is critical for healthy development.</p>
        <h4 id="ainsworths-attachment-styles">Ainsworth’s Attachment Styles</h4>
        <p>Mary Ainsworth identified styles of attachment in children:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Secure Attachment:</strong> Responsive caregivers foster trust and exploration.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Avoidant Attachment:</strong> Distant caregivers lead to discomfort in social settings.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Ambivalent Attachment:</strong> Inconsistent caregiver responses result in anxiety.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Disorganized Attachment:</strong> Abused or neglected children exhibit chaotic responses.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="longitudinal-studies">Longitudinal Studies</h4>
        <p>Longitudinal studies, including a 30-year project on attachment, revealed early childhood experiences significantly influence later social skills and behaviors.</p>
        <h4 id="social-engagement-and-longevity">Social Engagement and Longevity</h4>
        <p>Jonathan Haidt’s insights highlighted the value of strong social relationships in predicting happiness and longevity, exceeding traditional health factors like smoking cessation.</p>
        <h4 id="cultural-perspectives-on-flourishing">Cultural Perspectives on Flourishing</h4>
        <p>Research indicates that the significance of social engagement in well-being is consistent across cultures (e.g. studies from the U.S., France, Japan).</p>

        <h4 id="moral-development-and-political-philosophy">Moral Development and Political Philosophy</h4>
        <p>The connection between early nurturing experiences and later social behavior suggests implications for political structure and social policies. A stable, nurturing structure may promote just citizens, enhancing societal cohesion.</p>
        <h4 id="challenges-in-moral-reasoning">Challenges in Moral Reasoning</h4>
        <p>The lecture raised questions on moral judgments in child-rearing practices and whether trust inherently leads to a better societal structure. This invites a discourse on moral relativism and the structure of family in political philosophy.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-5">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The interaction between social relationships, ethical behavior, and flourishing posits that our earliest experiences with attachment inform our moral capacity and societal engagement.</p>

        <h3 id="aristotles-ethics-and-habits">Aristotle’s Ethics and Habits</h3>
        <p>According to Aristotle, habits are critical tools for transforming normative commitments (what we ought to do) into actual behaviors (what we do). The key concepts include:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"We learn a craft by producing the same product that we must produce when we’ve learned it."</p>

        <li><p>The agent must decide to perform the act because it is virtuous.</p></li>

        <p>The intersection of Aristotle’s moral theorizing and contemporary psychological insights provides a nuanced understanding of human behavior and self-regulation.

        <h1 id="lecture-notes-introduction-to-moral-philosophy">Lecture Notes: Introduction to Moral Philosophy</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-8">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In today’s lecture, we shift gears from the first unit focused on human flourishing. We have yet to examine the nature of morality in detail. Our goal is to introduce two prominent moral theories from Western philosophy and discuss their empirical research.</p>
        <h3 id="what-is-moral-philosophy">What is Moral Philosophy?</h3>
        <p>Moral philosophy systematically endeavors to understand moral concepts and justify moral principles and theories. It focuses on providing accounts for terms like:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Right and Wrong</p></li>
        <li><p>Permissible and Impermissible</p></li>
        <li><p>Ought and Ought Not</p></li>
        <li><p>Good and Bad</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moral philosophy is a <strong>normative</strong> enterprise, aiming to answer how people ought to act to align with moral constraints.</p>
        <h3 id="core-questions-of-moral-philosophy">Core Questions of Moral Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Moral philosophy seeks to provide principled answers to three kinds of questions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Moral Motivation:</strong> Why should we act morally?</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Moral Action:</strong> What actions ought we to take to be moral?</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Moral Justification:</strong> Why are certain actions considered moral or immoral?</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="moral-motivation">Moral Motivation</h4>
        <p>Answers to moral motivation can be categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Self-Interest Account:</strong> Behaving morally leads to personal benefits (e.g., Socratic harmony, societal stability).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Normative Features:</strong> Moral obligations exist as facts of the world.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Descriptive Behavior:</strong> Pro-social behavior is inherent to human nature (evolutionary perspective).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="moral-action">Moral Action</h4>
        <p>The second aspect focuses on specific moral actions. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Is it permissible to harm one to save many? (e.g., Jim and the Indians case)</p></li>
        <li><p>Our duties towards the less fortunate (e.g., Singer’s obligations toward third-world poverty).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="major-moral-theories-in-western-tradition">Major Moral Theories in Western Tradition</h3>
        <p>We will discuss four significant moral theories:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Utilitarianism</p></li>
        <li><p>Deontology (Kant)</p></li>
        <li><p>Virtue Ethics (Aristotle)</p></li>
        <li><p>Divine Command Theory</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h3>
        <p>Utilitarianism states that an action is morally right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number. <br /><span class="math display">Moral Rightness ∝ Utility Produced</span><br /> Mill emphasizes that:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="consequentialism">Consequentialism</h4>
        <p>Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, meaning the morality of an act is determined solely by its consequences, particularly its utility.</p>
        <h3 id="kants-deontological-framework">Kant’s Deontological Framework</h3>
        <p>Kant argues that the morality of an act is defined by the intention behind it, rather than its consequences. Mill suggests that motive does not affect the moral worth of an act:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>He who saves another creature from drowning does what is morally right whether his motive be duty or self-interest.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="comparative-analysis-of-moral-theories">Comparative Analysis of Moral Theories</h3>
        <h4 id="focus-areas">Focus Areas</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong> focuses on the character of the actor.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Deontology</strong> emphasizes the nature of the act itself.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)</strong> assesses the outcomes produced by the act.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="polls-and-case-studies">Polls and Case Studies</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Several case studies (the fan case, cookie case) illustrate utilitarian principles.</p></li>
        <li><p>In each case, the collective happiness produced by various actions was compared.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="case-example-fan-and-cookies">Case Example: Fan and Cookies</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><p>You get 100 units of happiness; 100 others get 1 unit each (Total = 200 units)</p></li>
        <li><p>If you angle the fan differently, you remain happy but others get 2 units (Total = 300 units)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The moral decision favored increasing the collective happiness without self-sacrifice.</p>
        <h4 id="final-case-the-omelas-dilemma">Final Case: The Omelas Dilemma</h4>
        <p>The Omelas story illustrates a society in which the happiness of many depends on the suffering of one child:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Does the happiness of the majority justify the suffering of the minority?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusions-and-further-discussion">Conclusions and Further Discussion</h3>
        <p>We are left with profound questions about moral obligations, the rightness of actions, and societal roles in moral behavior. The lecture sets the stage for further exploration of Kantian ethics and empirical critiques of utilitarianism.</p>
        <h1 id="lecture-notes-utilitarianism-and-kantian-ethics">Lecture Notes: Utilitarianism and Kantian Ethics</h1>
        <h3 id="utilitarianism-1">Utilitarianism</h3>
        <h4 id="overview-of-utilitarianism">Overview of Utilitarianism</h4>
        <p>Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that advocates for actions that promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. The central tenets of this theory were famously articulated by John Stuart Mill.</p>
        <h4 id="key-principles-of-mills-utilitarianism">Key Principles of Mill’s Utilitarianism</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Greatest Happiness Principle:</strong> Actions are considered right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. <br /><span class="math display">$$H = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_i$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> is the total happiness produced and <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the happiness contributed by each individual action.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Motive Irrelevance:</strong> The moral worth of an action is determined by its consequences, not the intentions behind it. For example, "He who saves another creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty or the hope of being paid for it."</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="critiques-of-utilitarianism">Critiques of Utilitarianism</h4>
        <p>Among the classical objections to utilitarianism are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>The Jim Case: Jim must choose between killing one individual to save the other nineteen or doing nothing, which results in the death of all twenty.</p></li>
        <li><p>Moral Compunction: Critics argue that even if utilitarian calculus dictates killing one to save the many, the emotional and moral hesitation felt by individuals is still important.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="kantian-ethics">Kantian Ethics</h3>
        <h4 id="overview-of-kants-deontological-ethics">Overview of Kant’s Deontological Ethics</h4>
        <p>Immanuel Kant’s moral philosophy places the emphasis on the intrinsic worth of actions, rather than the consequences. The key concepts in Kant’s ethics include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Categorical Imperative:</strong> The fundamental principle that guides moral action.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Good Will:</strong> The only thing that can be regarded as good without qualification.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="key-concepts-in-kantian-ethics">Key Concepts in Kantian Ethics</h4>
        <p>According to Kant:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Actions have moral worth only when done from duty, not out of inclination or self-interest.</p></li>
        <li><p>An action’s moral worth does not depend on its outcomes but rather on the maxim from which the action is performed. <br /><span class="math display">Moral Worth ⟹ Action from Duty</span><br /></p></li>
        <li><p>Duty is defined as the necessity of an action done out of respect for the moral law.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="formulations-of-the-categorical-imperative">Formulations of the Categorical Imperative</h4>
        <p>Kant articulates the Categorical Imperative in various formulations:</p>
        <p>1. Universalizability: <br /><span class="math display">Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.</span><br /></p>
        <p>2. Humanity: <br /><span class="math display">Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means.</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="applications-of-kants-ethics">Applications of Kant’s Ethics</h4>
        <p>Kant uses examples such as the “lying promise” to illustrate the Categorical Imperative. In a lying promise made with the intention of deceiving, the maxim cannot be universalized without contradiction, therefore, it fails to conform to moral law.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-9">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In summary, the lecture explored successive ethical theories: - The consequences-focused utilitarianism that prioritizes overall happiness and the objections to it, notably concerning individual moral agency. - Kant’s deontological framework which places value on the intentions behind actions and their alignment with universal moral principles.</p>
        <p>Future discussions will delve deeper into Kant’s Categorical Imperative and its implications in various moral dilemmas.</p>
        <h1 id="lecture-notes-kantian-ethics-and-the-trolley-problem">Lecture Notes: Kantian Ethics and the Trolley Problem</h1>
        <h3 id="overview-3">Overview</h3>
        <p>In today’s lecture, we cover two primary topics:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Completion of our discussion of deontology, focusing on Kant’s ethical framework.</p></li>
        <li><p>An introduction to Judith Jarvis Thomson’s analysis of the trolley problem.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="kantian-ethics-1">Kantian Ethics</h3>
        <p>We review three critical claims from Kant’s <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em>:</p>
        <h4 id="first-claim-moral-worth-and-duty">First Claim: Moral Worth and Duty</h4>
        <p>An action must be done <strong>from duty</strong> to have moral worth.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Distinction is drawn between acting in accordance with duty versus acting from duty.</p></li>
        <li><p>Moral worth is determined not just by conformity to moral law, but by the intention to act for the sake of duty.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="second-claim-the-role-of-maxims">Second Claim: The Role of Maxims</h4>
        <p>The moral worth of an action comes from its <strong>maxim</strong>, not from the purpose of the action.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A <em>maxim</em> is a principle that underlies an action.</p></li>
        <li><p>To determine moral worth, we assess the description under which the action is performed.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="third-claim-duty-and-moral-law">Third Claim: Duty and Moral Law</h4>
        <p>Kant defines <strong>duty</strong> as the necessity of an action performed out of respect for the law.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Acting in accordance with the moral law must be done with recognition of its binding nature.</p></li>
        <li><p>This self-imposed law stems from rationality and is not influenced by external contingencies.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="categorical-imperative">Categorical Imperative</h3>
        <p>Kant’s categorical imperative serves as a foundational principle of morality:</p>
        <h4 id="formula-of-universal-law">Formula of Universal Law</h4>
        <p><em>Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.</em></p>
        <h4 id="formula-of-humanity">Formula of Humanity</h4>
        <p><em>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</em></p>
        <h4 id="formula-of-autonomy">Formula of Autonomy</h4>
        <p><em>Act so that your will can regard itself at the same time as making universal law.</em></p>
        <h4 id="kingdom-of-ends">Kingdom of Ends</h4>
        <p><em>Act according to the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a possible kingdom of ends.</em></p>
        <h3 id="the-trolley-problem-thomsons-analysis">The Trolley Problem: Thomson’s Analysis</h3>
        <p>We explore Thomson’s challenge to intuitions around the trolley problem and related scenarios:</p>
        <h4 id="trolley-driver-scenario">Trolley Driver Scenario</h4>
        <p>A trolley is headed toward five individuals, and the driver must decide whether to divert it to a track with one individual.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Options:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>A: Morally mandatory to divert the trolley.</p></li>
        <li><p>B: Morally permitted, but not mandatory.</p></li>
        <li><p>C: Morally prohibited to divert the trolley.</p></li>
        </ol></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="transplant-scenario">Transplant Scenario</h4>
        <p>A doctor could save five patients in need of organs by sacrificing one healthy individual.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The majority view is that it is morally prohibited to sacrifice the healthy individual.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="comparison-of-intuitions">Comparison of Intuitions</h4>
        <p>Thomson contrasts these cases to reveal inconsistencies in moral reasoning between killing versus letting die.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Killing vs. Letting Die:</strong> The distinction is examined to assess moral permissibility.</p></li>

        <h4 id="bystander-effect-and-loop-scenario">Bystander Effect and Loop Scenario</h4>
        <p>Debates arise when discussing Jim’s choice to divert the trolley versus the implications of using a person as a means to an end.</p>
        <h4 id="final-thought-experiment-the-fat-man">Final Thought Experiment: The Fat Man</h4>
        <p>Revisiting intuitions about whether to push a large man off a bridge to stop a trolley illustrates divergence in responses.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Survey results showcase a significant change in moral judgment compared to earlier scenarios.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
        <p>The lecture explored Kant’s foundational ideas of moral duty and the categorical imperative, leading to a deeper engagement with moral intuitions illustrated through Thomson’s trolley problem. The contrasts in responses illuminate complex ethical dilemmas and the implications of utilitarian versus deontological reasoning.</p>
        <h1 id="ethics-of-the-trolley-problem-lecture-notes">Ethics of the Trolley Problem: Lecture Notes</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-9">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The trolley problem presents a moral dilemma involving choices about saving lives. This lecture delves into Judith Thomson’s cases: the Classic Bystander Case and the Fat Man case, discussing variations in moral intuitions and responses.</p>
        <h3 id="the-classic-bystander-case">The Classic Bystander Case</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Situation: A trolley is about to run over five people. A bystander can pull a lever to redirect the trolley to kill one person instead.</p></li>
        <li><p>Class Response Distribution:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>15% thought it was morally required to pull the lever (kill one to save five).</p></li>
        <li><p>70% thought it was morally permitted.</p></li>
        <li><p>15% thought it was morally prohibited.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="thomsons-fat-man-case">Thomson’s Fat Man Case</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Situation: A bystander can push a fat man off a bridge to stop the trolley from hitting five people.</p></li>
        <li><p>Class Response Distribution:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>78% believed it was morally prohibited to push the fat man.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The differing distribution of responses between the two cases raises the question: Why do we judge these scenarios differently despite similar outcomes?</p>
        <h3 id="thomsons-analysis">Thomson’s Analysis</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Thomson argues that while utilitarian reasoning suggests saving the five is better, the concept of rights prevents killing the one (the fat man).</p></li>
        <li><p>Key distinction:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>In the Bystander case, no rights are infringed.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the Fat Man case, rights are violated (using a person as a means to an end).</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="three-non-classic-responses">Three Non-Classic Responses</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Thomson’s 2008 View: Rethinking Cases</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>She presents a scenario where a bystander has a choice between letting the trolley hit five, deflecting to one person, or redirecting it to hit themselves (Bystander’s Three Options).</p></li>
        <li><p>The moral implications again spur different responses.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Josh Greene’s Utilitarian View</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Greene argues for a consistent response across cases: in both the Bystander and Fat Man scenarios, utilitarianism mandates causing the death of one to save five.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Cass Sunstein’s Heuristics Approach</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Sunstein suggests that moral reasoning often relies on heuristics, similar to non-moral reasoning. This could lead to systematic errors in moral judgment.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="experiments-and-observations">Experiments and Observations</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Thomson presents cases demonstrating that as personal stakes increase (e.g., when one risks oneself), moral intuitions shift.</p></li>

        <li><p>The availability heuristic: how easily one can recall instances can skew perception of risk.</p></li>
        <li><p>The representative heuristic: misjudging probabilities due to overly focusing on typical instances.</p></li>

        <h3 id="introduction-10">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The lecture resumed the examination of the perplexities arising from the trolley problem, focusing on the apparent asymmetry in responses to different iterations of the case, specifically the Bystander and Fat Man cases.</p>
        <h3 id="the-trolley-problem">The Trolley Problem</h3>
        <h4 id="overview-of-cases">Overview of Cases</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Bystander Case:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>You can pull a lever to divert a trolley onto a track where it will kill one person instead of five.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fat Man Case:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>You can push a person off a bridge onto the track to stop the trolley, killing that one person but saving five.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The lecture highlighted two philosophical responses to these cases:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Judith Thomson’s Position:</strong> There is no moral asymmetry; reflecting on additional cases reveals similar moral outcomes in both scenarios.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Josh Greene’s Position:</strong> The emotional response elicited by closeness to the moral act (in Fat Man) leads to inconsistent moral judgments which he argues are unjustified.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="cass-sunsteins-argument">Cass Sunstein’s Argument</h3>
        <p>Sunstein proposes a middle ground, suggesting both cases are morally comparable at a deeper level. His analysis includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The impact of heuristics in moral reasoning, akin to cognitive biases in non-moral decision-making.</p></li>
        <li><p>Examples from Jonathan Haidt’s work highlighting moral disapprobation in certain scenarios lacking clear justification.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Subsequently, the class discussed the framing effects in moral dilemmas: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Plan A: Live - } 200 \text{ of 600, } \quad \text{Plan B: Live - } \frac{1}{3}(600) \text{ (probability)}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="framing-effects-1">Framing Effects</h4>
        <p>Sunstein explored the Asian disease problem to illustrate how different presentations (number who will live vs number who will die) yield dramatically different moral responses despite identical mathematical outcomes.</p>
        <h3 id="different-domains-of-moral-judgment">Different Domains of Moral Judgment</h3>
        <p>Sunstein indicated several areas where heuristics influence moral and risk-based decisions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Risk Regulation:</strong> How we perceive and handle risks in various contexts.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Punishment:</strong> Analysis of differences in how we punish individuals versus groups.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="examples-of-heuristics-and-moral-judgment">Examples of Heuristics and Moral Judgment</h3>
        <p>The class application of clickers illustrated various examples of moral principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Company Risk Assessment:</strong> Condemnation differs based on certainty vs risk.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Car and Driver Case:</strong> Unlucky conditions impact blame (i.e., cell phone use while driving).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="moral-luck">Moral Luck</h3>
        <p>The concept of <em>moral luck</em> was introduced, noting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Two individuals might take identical actions but experience different moral evaluations based on outcomes unpredictable by the agents.</p></li>
        <li><p>A notable psychological discomfort arises when examining agents who do not intend harm but face unfortunate consequences.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="types-of-moral-luck">Types of Moral Luck</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Resultant Luck:</strong> Differences in outcomes of similar actions (e.g., hitting a child).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Constitutive Luck:</strong> Differences in character due to factors beyond control.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Circumstantial Luck:</strong> The context that influences moral behaviors.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="responses-to-moral-luck">Responses to Moral Luck</h4>
        <p>Philosophers suggest three responses:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Rationalist Response:</strong> Reject moral luck in assessments.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Irrationalist Attitude:</strong> Accept luck as influencing praise/blame.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Pragmatic Attitude:</strong> Propose that there are constraints on moral evaluation.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-10">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The lecture concluded with the assertion that our moral frameworks must navigate competing principles: the control principle versus the moral luck principle. There is no clear resolution, leaving the discussion open for further philosophical inquiry on moral agency and responsibility.</p>

        <h3 id="overview-of-course-structure">Overview of Course Structure</h3>
        <p>The lecture series progresses through three distinct yet interconnected topics:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Individual Flourishing: Focused on human beings achieving internal harmony.</p></li>
        <li><p>Morality and Interpersonal Relations: Examines moral responsibility in relationships.</p></li>
        <li><p>Political Structures: Investigates how political frameworks can cultivate individual behaviors.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The unit on punishment serves as a transitional phase between morality and political philosophy.</p>
        <h3 id="starting-class-with-clicker-questions">Starting Class with Clicker Questions</h3>
        <p>The professor engages students with clicker questions to reflect on moral dilemmas similar to the trolley problems, transitioning to discussions of punishment.</p>
        <h4 id="the-trolley-problem-1">The Trolley Problem</h4>
        <p>The classic <em>Trolley Bystander case</em> presents a scenario in which a bystander must choose whether to divert a trolley, threatening the lives of five people on one track or one person on another.</p>
        <h5 id="real-world-application-the-nuclear-case">Real-World Application: The Nuclear Case</h5>
        <p>Consider the scenario where as the Japanese Prime Minister, a radioactive cloud threatens Tokyo (13 million people), and diverting it to a rural area (1 million people) is an option. The ethical considerations are numerous:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Morally mandatory to redirect the plume?</p></li>
        <li><p>Morally permitted but not mandatory?</p></li>
        <li><p>Morally prohibited?</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="discussion-of-responses">Discussion of Responses</h4>
        <p>Responses indicated that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>31% believe redirection is morally mandatory.</p></li>
        <li><p>56% view it as morally permitted;</p></li>
        <li><p>13% think it is morally prohibited.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="harms-way-case">Harm’s Way Case</h3>
        <p>Involves a situation where a small group of engineers might be conscripted into certain death to save a larger population. Ethical questions arise surrounding the justification of such actions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Morally mandatory?</p></li>
        <li><p>Morally permitted but not mandatory?</p></li>
        <li><p>Morally prohibited?</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="responses">Responses</h4>
        <p>The responses varied significantly compared to the fat man case, emphasizing:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>27% think it’s prohibited.</p></li>
        <li><p>41% think it’s permitted but not mandatory.</p></li>
        <li><p>32% believe it’s morally prohibited.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="moral-responsibility-and-punishment">Moral Responsibility and Punishment</h3>
        <p>Transitioning into discussions of punishment, the class considers whom we hold morally responsible and the psychology behind perceived deservingness of punishment.</p>
        <h4 id="characteristics-of-civil-punishment">Characteristics of Civil Punishment</h4>
        <p>According to the lecture, punishment broadly includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Involvement of unpleasantness/suffering.</p></li>
        <li><p>A response to a specific legal or moral offense.</p></li>
        <li><p>Intentional administration by human agents.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sanction by legal authority or institutions.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="theories-of-justification-for-punishment">Theories of Justification for Punishment</h3>
        <p>Two predominant justifications are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Utilitarian Justification: Punishment serves as a deterrent to future harm and is justified by its consequences.</p></li>
        <li><p>Deontological Justification: Punishment is deserved because it addresses wrongdoing according to moral or legal codes.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="restitution-and-rehabilitation">Restitution and Rehabilitation</h3>
        <p>Additional frameworks discussed include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Restitution</strong>: Restoring the victim to pre-harm conditions (e.g., return of stolen property).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong>: Facilitating re-socialization of the offender towards pro-social behavior.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="restoration-of-pre-harm-state">Restoration of Pre-Harm State</h4>
        <p>Using Gyges and Pedro’s example, various forms of appropriate responses to offenses are analyzed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If a horse is stolen, restitution would involve returning the horse.</p></li>
        <li><p>If a horse is killed, one might require replacing it with an equivalent horse.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-retributive-perspective">The Retributive Perspective</h3>
        <p>Kant’s view on punishment focuses on moral desert, where punishment is not merely a tool for social order but a response to the moral violation itself:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Juridical punishment can never be administered merely as a means for promoting another good.” – Immanuel Kant</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>### Key Points to Remember - Punishment acknowledges the moral order. - It stems from a societal need to restore balance and justice. - Justice involves punishment being proportional to the crime committed.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-11">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Also noted were the complexities surrounding retributive versus revenge-based punishment. It raises questions on personal involvement versus societal responsibility in justice.</p>
        <p>Considerations of utilitarian methods of punishment will be further explored in the next class.</p>
        <h1 id="lecture-notes-on-punishment">Lecture Notes on Punishment</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-11">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we explore the justification for punishment from both consequentialist and retributivist perspectives. We examine how moral and legal norms are established and what justifies punitive actions when those norms are violated.</p>
        <h3 id="moral-norms-and-punishment">Moral Norms and Punishment</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Before discussing punishment, we considered moral norms and principles that underpin them.</p></li>
        <li><p>Now focusing on the implications of violations of these norms.</p></li>
        <li><p>We explore different justifications for punishment, emphasizing restitution and rehabilitation.</p></li>
        <li><p>The focus of today’s discussion is on consequentialist views of punishment.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="characterization-of-punishment">Characterization of Punishment</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Punishment is an action imposed by one judge on an offender in response to a legal offense, involving the intentional infliction of unpleasantness or suffering.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The central question is how states justify imposing disutility on individuals who violate norms.</p>
        <h3 id="consequentialist-justification">Consequentialist Justification</h3>
        <p>Consequentialists argue that the primary justifications for punishment are <strong>deterrence</strong> and <strong>prevention</strong> of future offenses. This entails:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Deterrence</strong>: Punishment should change the cost-benefit analysis of committing a crime.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Punishment must prevent future crimes. If there are equally effective alternatives that do not involve punishment, then punishment is unjustified.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jeremy Bentham emphasizes that punishment must:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Change the calculus of costs and benefits associated with a crime, making the act appear less desirable.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="challenges-to-consequentialist-justifications">Challenges to Consequentialist Justifications</h3>
        <h4 id="under-generation-of-punishment">Under-Generation of Punishment</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Consequentialist reasoning under-generates reasons for punishment because non-punitive alternatives may suffice for incapacitating offenders.</p></li>
        <li><p>For instance, if incapacitating someone does not require suffering beyond what is necessary, extra suffering cannot be justified.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="over-generation-of-punishment">Over-Generation of Punishment</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Consequentialism could lead to punishment of innocent individuals if it serves the goal of deterrence (e.g., punishing an innocent person to frighten others).</p></li>
        <li><p>This practice, known as <em>telishment</em>, fails to maintain moral standards.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
        <p>Consider a scenario where an innocent person is punished to deter future crimes. This raises ethical concerns as it contradicts established norms of fairness.</p>
        <h3 id="two-level-theory-of-punishment">Two-Level Theory of Punishment</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>John Rawls suggests a two-level approach:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Justification of the practice of punishment is based on societal utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Justification for specific punishments relies on retributive justice.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>This framework may address under-generation and over-generation issues.</p></li>

        <h4 id="intuitive-responses">Intuitive Responses</h4>
        <p>Psychological studies reveal that people’s intuitive responses to punishment considerations frequently focus on:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Retribution</strong>: Emphasizing the wrongness of an act, considering intention and motive.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Consequentialism</strong>: Looking for how punishment affects societal outcomes or deters behavior.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="altruistic-punishment">Altruistic Punishment</h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Altruistic punishers impose costs on wrongdoers, often at their own expense, to address norm violations not directly affecting them.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="impact-of-luck-on-punishment">Impact of Luck on Punishment</h3>
        <h4 id="moral-luck-1">Moral Luck</h4>
        <p>Moral and legal assessments of actions are often influenced by luck (e.g., success or failure of a crime). Consider:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If a person intends to harm yet fails due to luck, should they be punished less severely than someone who succeeds?</p></li>
        <li><p>David Lewis argues that equating punishment simply with outcomes can lead to a “penal lottery” approach, where individuals are punished based on luck rather than intention.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-and-further-questions">Conclusion and Further Questions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Can utility alone justify the practice of punishment, or does it lead to under-generation issues?</p></li>
        <li><p>Can retribution alone adequately justify actions within the punitive practice?</p></li>
        <li><p>How do we maintain coherence in our understanding of punishment while considering both retributive and consequentialist elements?</p></li>

        <h3 id="introduction-13">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Today, we explore the concept of the Prisoners’ Dilemma, a fundamental notion in game theory that discusses cooperation versus competition. This concept appears in both Plato’s <em>Republic</em> and Hobbes’ <em>Leviathan</em>.</p>
        <h3 id="philosophical-context">Philosophical Context</h3>
        <h4 id="platos-republic">Plato’s Republic</h4>
        <p>In Book Two of <em>Republic</em>, Glaucon argues about the nature and origin of justice. The key takeaway is:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"They say that to do justice is naturally good, to suffer injustice is bad, but that the badness of suffering so far exceeds the goodness of doing it that those who have done and suffered injustice... decide that it’s profitable to come to an agreement with each other neither to do injustice nor suffer it."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="hobbes-leviathan-1">Hobbes’ Leviathan</h4>
        <p>In Chapter 13, Hobbes articulates the laws of nature:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>First Law of Nature</strong>: Seek peace if it can be obtained; if not, engage in war.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Second Law of Nature</strong>: Lay down rights to the extent others are willing to do the same.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="the-structure-of-the-prisoners-dilemma">The Structure of the Prisoners’ Dilemma</h3>
        <p>The Prisoners’ Dilemma can be illustrated using a two-by-two payoff matrix:</p>
        <p>In this matrix:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>(3,3): Both cooperate (preferred outcome).</p></li>
        <li><p>(0,5): A cooperates, B defects.</p></li>
        <li><p>(5,0): A defects, B cooperates.</p></li>
        <li><p>(1,1): Both defect (worst outcome).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="preferences-and-rational-choices">Preferences and Rational Choices</h3>
        <h4 id="rationality-for-player-a">Rationality for Player A</h4>
        <p>Player A prefers:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>First choice: A defects, B cooperates <span class="math inline">(5, 0)</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Fourth choice: Both cooperate <span class="math inline">(3, 3)</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given this structure, A’s rational choice is to defect if player B is expected to defect as well: <br /><span class="math display">If A defects, she maximizes her payoff: <em>A</em> → {5, 1} (preferred over 3)</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="rationality-for-player-b">Rationality for Player B</h4>
        <p>Player B has the same reasoning:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>First choice: B defects, A cooperates <span class="math inline">(0, 5)</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Fourth choice: Both cooperate <span class="math inline">(3, 3)</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, B will also choose to defect regardless of A’s choice.</p>
        <h3 id="the-dilemma-and-its-implications">The Dilemma and Its Implications</h3>
        <h4 id="outcome">Outcome</h4>
        <p>In typical iterations of the game, both players end up in the equilibrium of defecting, represented by (1,1). This reflects a stable outcome despite the possibility for mutual cooperation, demonstrating the dilemma.</p>

        <p>The Prisoners’ Dilemma can be generalized to various scenarios, including:</p>

        <li><p>Economic competition (price wars)</p></li>
        <li><p>Social issues (public goods)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="strategies-for-cooperation">Strategies for Cooperation</h3>
        <p>To escape the Prisoners’ Dilemma, strategies should be implemented:</p>
        <h4 id="external-mechanisms">External Mechanisms</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Introduce rewards for cooperative behavior.</p></li>

        <h3 id="introduction-15">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Today’s lecture contrasts John Rawls’ <em>Theory of Justice</em> with Robert Nozick’s <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</em>. Central themes will include notions of justice, inviolability, and the legitimacy of state authority.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>"Justice is the first virtue of social institutions."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Justice serves an essential role in legitimizing institutions, analogous to how truth validates systems of thought. Rawls states:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="core-argument">Core Argument</h4>
        <p>Rawls posits that injustices to individual freedom cannot be justified for the sake of a greater good:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others."</p>

        <h4 id="inviolability-and-rights">Inviolability and Rights</h4>
        <p>Nozick emphasizes <em>rights</em> over <em>justice</em>. He asserts:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Individuals have rights and there are things that no person or group may do to them without violating those rights."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="minimal-state-justification">Minimal State Justification</h4>
        <p>Nozick argues for a minimal state limited to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Protection against force</p></li>
        <li><p>Protection against theft</p></li>
        <li><p>Protection against fraud</p></li>

        <h3 id="nozicks-justice-in-holdings">Nozick’s Justice in Holdings</h3>
        <h4 id="three-principles-of-justice-in-holdings">Three Principles of Justice in Holdings</h4>
        <p>Nozick delineates a structured approach to justice regarding property:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Justice in Acquisition</strong>: Conditions under which one can rightfully acquire unowned goods.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Justice in Transfer</strong>: Conditions under which one can transfer goods to another without violating rights.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Rectification of Injustice</strong>: Method by which one can recover goods taken by unjust means.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="inductive-definition-of-justice-in-holdings">Inductive Definition of Justice in Holdings</h4>
        <p>Nozick’s inductive definition encapsulates:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If a person acquires a holding in keeping with the principle of justice in acquisition, the person is entitled to the holding.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h6 id="induction-clause">Induction Clause:</h6>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If a person acquires a holding in keeping with the principle of justice in transfer, from someone entitled to hold it, then the person is entitled to it.</p>

        <h6 id="closure-clause">Closure Clause:</h6>
        <blockquote>
        <p>No one is entitled to a holding except by repeated applications of (1) and (2).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="historical-principle-of-justice">Historical Principle of Justice</h4>
        <p>Nozick argues that justice in holdings is historical; it relies on the actual processes of acquisition and transfer:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Unjust acquisition leads to unjust holdings.</p></li>
        <li><p>Just acquisitions followed by unjust transfers still yield unjust holdings.</p></li>

        <h4 id="lockes-view-on-property">Locke’s View on Property</h4>
        <p>Nozick references Locke: Individuals mix their labor with unowned resources to create property rights. Locke states:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Though the Earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="violations-of-the-lockean-proviso">Violations of the Lockean Proviso</h4>
        <p>Nozick’s primary concern is whether the Lockean Proviso (i.e., ensuring "enough and as good left in common for others") is often violated. He argues the appropriation of property usually does not violate this proviso and claims:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Acquisition of property does not typically harm others."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="wilt-chamberlain-example">Wilt Chamberlain Example</h4>
        <p>Nozick employs Wilt Chamberlain’s example to illustrate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The process of voluntary transfer can lead to inequality without injustice.</p></li>
        <li><p>Justice is about the process, not the end result (i.e., it is a historical principle).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-15">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The lecture concludes by synthesizing Rawls and Nozick’s theories, emphasizing the relevance of their differing concepts of justice and rights in contemporary political philosophy. Future discussions will further explore justice in holdings and its implications.</p>
        <h1 id="lecture-notes-on-liberty-and-political-philosophy">Lecture Notes on Liberty and Political Philosophy</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-16">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The lecture explored the ideas of liberty and property ownership as articulated by Nozick and Rawls, emphasizing the role of luck in human experiences and examining the structures that shape society.</p>
        <h3 id="nozicks-framework-for-political-philosophy">Nozick’s Framework for Political Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Nozick prioritizes liberty and rights in his political philosophy, particularly in Chapter 7 of <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</em>. He delineates three main aspects of justice related to property ownership:</p>
        <h4 id="justice-in-acquisition">1. Justice in Acquisition</h4>
        <p>A person may claim ownership over unowned property if they do not violate the Lockean Proviso, which asserts that one must leave "as much and as good for others."<br />
        Objections:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Unzipping Problem: If ownership diminishes available resources, the first acquisition may also be deemed illegitimate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Commons Problem: Even if the initial acquisition is legitimate, eventual ownership creates disadvantages for others.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="justice-in-transfer">2. Justice in Transfer</h4>
        <p>Nozick argues that voluntary transfers between individuals are legitimate. Any restrictions on property transfer are viewed as infringements on freedom.</p>
        <h4 id="rectification-of-injustice">3. Rectification of Injustice</h4>
        <p>If property is illegitimately acquired, whether initially or via illegitimate transfer, rectification is necessary. Nozick acknowledges historical injustices, prompting potential temporary state actions to benefit the least well-off.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Nozick: "Perhaps a good rule of thumb is to organize society to benefit the least well off."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="rawls-vs.-nozick">Rawls vs. Nozick</h3>
        <p>Nozick rejects a system of natural liberty that leads to morally arbitrary distributions. He critiques Rawls’s focus on moral luck, arguing for the importance of individual choices and autonomy.<br />
        Rawls holds that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Individuals have basic rights that cannot be overridden by utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Inequalities should benefit the least well off and offices should be equally open.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="moral-luck-and-individual-responsibility">Moral Luck and Individual Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Both philosophers wrestle with moral luck, exploring how factors beyond individual control affect societal roles and distributions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Epictetus: Asserts some things are within our control, and others are not.</p></li>
        <li><p>Nozick criticizes the denigration of autonomy in evaluating individuals solely based on their circumstances.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="social-structures-and-human-behavior">Social Structures and Human Behavior</h3>
        <p>The lecture transitions to the impact of social structures on individual behavior, a topic echoed in the works of Aristotle and John Stuart Mill:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Aristotle remarked on laws shaping character and behavior: "It’s difficult for somebody to be trained correctly from his youth if he’s not brought up under correct laws."</p></li>
        <li><p>Mill emphasized the harmony of individual happiness with societal well-being.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="empirical-evidence-on-cultural-influence">Empirical Evidence on Cultural Influence</h4>
        <p>Discussed a survey article from <em>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</em> suggesting that WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) individuals exhibit different cognitive styles compared to those from non-Western backgrounds.</p>
        <h4 id="key-findings-from-weird-research">Key Findings from WEIRD Research</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Perception: Cultural background influences how individuals perceive and interpret stimuli. For instance, participants from Western societies show typical biases based on their environments which do not affect non-Western subjects.</p></li>
        <li><p>Self-Concept and Individualism: Surveys indicate fundamental differences in attitudes toward community, responsibility, and corporate goals between cultures.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="conclusion-16">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The complex interplay between individual autonomy, societal structures, and moral considerations forms the crux of political philosophy. Philosophers like Nozick and Rawls provide foundations for discussing justice and liberty, while empirical studies illustrate the profound impact of cultural context on human behavior.</p>
