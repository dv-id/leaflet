        <h3 id="what-is-microeconomics">What is Microeconomics?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Definition: Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make decisions in a world of scarcity.</p></li>
        <li><p>Scarcity drives microeconomic analysis:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Economic agents engage in constrained optimization to maximize their well-being.</strong></p></li>
        <li><p>Key Concept: <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action.</p></li>
        <li><p>Example: If one decides to buy a shirt over pants, the opportunity cost is the value of the pants not purchased.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Economics is often referred to as the <em>"dismal science"</em> because it emphasizes that nothing is free and every action has an associated cost.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="supply-and-demand-model">Supply and Demand Model</h3>
        <h4 id="introduction-to-supply-and-demand">Introduction to Supply and Demand</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Importance of Adam Smith’s work and the "water-diamond paradox":</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Water is essential for life but is typically cheap.</p></li>
        <li><p>Diamonds are not essential but are expensive due to limited supply.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="market-dynamics">Market Dynamics</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The market is analyzed through supply and demand curves.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Demand Curve</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Representation of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Law of Demand:</em> As price increases, quantity demanded decreases (downward-sloping curve).</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Supply Curve</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Representation of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Law of Supply:</em> As price increases, quantity supplied increases (upward-sloping curve).</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Market Equilibrium</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The point where the supply and demand curves intersect.</p></li>
        <li><p>At equilibrium price <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> and quantity <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span>, both consumers and producers are satisfied.</p></li>
        <li><p>Example: If <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> = 3</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> = 600</span> for roses, this represents the price and quantity at equilibrium.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="positive-vs.-normative-analysis">Positive vs. Normative Analysis</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Positive Analysis</strong>: The study of how things are (e.g., supply and demand in action).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Normative Analysis</strong>: The study of how things should be (e.g., ethical implications of allowing kidney sales).</p></li>
        <li><p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The case of kidneys on eBay raised questions about the implicit value of life and access to healthcare.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="market-structures">Market Structures</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Discussion on capitalistic economies vs. command economies:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>In a capitalistic economy, decisions on production and consumption are made by individuals and firms.</p></li>
        <li><p>Command economies involve central planning where the government makes these decisions.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>The balance between efficiency (of markets) and equity (fairness in outcomes) is a core debate in economics.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The demand curve represents consumer preferences and choices in the context of the supply and demand model in economics. The objective is to understand how these curves emerge from the utility maximization behavior of consumers.</p>
        <h3 id="model-of-consumer-decision-making">Model of Consumer Decision Making</h3>
        <p>The model of consumer decision making revolves around two essential components:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Consumer Preferences: What individuals want.</p></li>
        <li><p>Budget Constraint: What individuals can afford.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The goal is to maximize utility (happiness) given these constraints.</p>
        <h3 id="preferences-and-utility-functions">Preferences and Utility Functions</h3>
        <h4 id="assumptions-about-preferences">Assumptions about Preferences</h4>
        <p>To build our model, we start with three key assumptions regarding preferences:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Completeness:</strong> Consumers can express preferences over any set of goods. They cannot claim indifference without expressing a choice.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Transitivity:</strong> If a consumer prefers <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>, then they must prefer <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Nonsatiation:</strong> More is always better than less. That is, consumers will always prefer more of a good to less.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="indifference-curves">Indifference Curves</h4>
        <p>Indifference curves graphically represent preferences. Each curve represents a set of consumption combinations among which consumers are indifferent.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>An indifference curve illustrates all combinations of goods that provide the same level of utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Properties of indifference curves include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Higher curves represent higher utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Indifference curves are downward sloping.</p></li>
        <li><p>Indifference curves never cross.</p></li>
        <li><p>Only one curve can pass through a given consumption bundle.</p></li>
        </ol></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="utility-functions">Utility Functions</h3>
        <p>Every individual has an underlying utility function, representing their preferences mathematically. A simple utility function for two goods (e.g., pizza and cookies) could be: <br /><span class="math display">$$U(P, C) = \sqrt{P \times C}$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> is the amount of pizza and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is the amount of cookies.</p>
        <h4 id="marginal-utility">Marginal Utility</h4>
        <p>Marginal utility is the change in utility resulting from a one-unit change in the quantity of a good. <br /><span class="math display">$$MU_C = \frac{\partial U}{\partial C}$$</span><br /> The concept of diminishing marginal utility suggests that as more of a good is consumed, the additional utility gained from consuming an extra unit decreases.</p>
        <h3 id="marginal-rate-of-substitution-mrs">Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)</h3>
        <p>The marginal rate of substitution tells us the rate at which a consumer is willing to substitute one good for another while keeping utility constant. It is defined as: <br /><span class="math display">$$MRS = -\frac{MU_C}{MU_P}$$</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>U</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span> is the marginal utility of cookies and <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>U</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> is the marginal utility of pizza.</p>
        <h4 id="properties-of-mrs">Properties of MRS</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>MRS is diminishing: As a consumer consumes more cookies, they are willing to give up fewer slices of pizza for each additional cookie, reflecting the principle of diminishing marginal utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Indifference curves are convex to the origin: This is a direct implication of the diminishing MRS.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="practical-implications-of-utility-theory">Practical Implications of Utility Theory</h3>
        <p>Understanding these concepts helps explain real-world pricing strategies. For instance:<br />
        <br />
        The prices for larger sizes of beverages (in stores like Starbucks or McDonald’s) often reflect the diminishing marginal utility; thus, larger sizes are disproportionately cheaper than smaller ones for consumers.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Today’s focus was on consumer preferences, utility functions, and the derivation of the demand curve from these concepts. The next topic will involve budget constraints and the implications for demand.</p>
        <h1 id="consumer-choice-and-budget-constraints">Consumer Choice and Budget Constraints</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we focus on consumer choice under budget constraints. Specifically, we will elaborate on the construction of budget constraints, how consumers make constrained choices, and an illustrative example using food stamps.</p>
        <h3 id="budget-constraints">Budget Constraints</h3>
        <p>A budget constraint represents the limit on a consumer’s choices, given their income and the prices of goods.</p>
        <h4 id="fundamental-axiom-of-consumer-choice">Fundamental Axiom of Consumer Choice</h4>
        <p>The fundamental axiom of consumer choice is that "more is better." However, consumers are limited by their budget, which defines what goods they can purchase.</p>
        <h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h4>
        <p>For the purpose of this discussion, we assume:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Budget equals income: <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> = <em>I</em></span></p></li>
        <li><p>No savings or borrowing</p></li>
        <li><p>The consumer allocates their income between two goods: pizza and cookies</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>: Total income (money available to spend)</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>: Number of pizzas</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>: Number of cookies</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>: Price per pizza slice</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span>: Price per cookie</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The budget constraint can be represented mathematically as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>p</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> ⋅ <em>P</em> + <em>p</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> ⋅ <em>C</em> ≤ <em>Y</em></span><br /></p>
        <h5 id="calculation-of-intercepts">Calculation of Intercepts</h5>
        <p>The intercepts of the budget constraint are calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Y-intercept (max pizzas): <span class="math inline">$\frac{Y}{p_P}$</span></p></li>
        <li><p>X-intercept (max cookies): <span class="math inline">$\frac{Y}{p_C}$</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, with <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> = 72</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> = 12</span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = 6</span>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Max pizzas = <span class="math inline">$\frac{72}{12} = 6$</span></p></li>
        <li><p>Max cookies = <span class="math inline">$\frac{72}{6} = 12$</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="slope-of-the-budget-constraint">Slope of the Budget Constraint</h4>
        <p>The slope of the budget constraint (the Marginal Rate of Transformation, MRT) is given by: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{MRT} = -\frac{p_C}{p_P}$$</span><br /> This indicates the rate at which one good can be substituted for another while keeping the budget constant.</p>
        <h4 id="opportunity-cost">Opportunity Cost</h4>
        <p>The opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative foregone. For example, the opportunity cost of one slice of pizza equals two cookies when the prices are as defined above.</p>
        <h3 id="consumer-choices-under-constraints">Consumer Choices Under Constraints</h3>
        <p>Consumers aim to maximize their utility subject to their budget constraint.</p>
        <h4 id="utility-maximization">Utility Maximization</h4>
        <p>Consumers will choose a combination of goods that maximizes their utility, subject to the budget constraint. The utility can be represented with a function: <br /><span class="math display">$$U(P, C) = \sqrt{P \cdot C}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="indifference-curves-1">Indifference Curves</h4>
        <p>Graphically, the highest attainable indifference curve under the budget constraint represents the optimal choice for the consumer. The point of tangency between the indifference curve and the budget constraint represents the optimal consumption bundle.</p>
        <h3 id="food-stamps-example">Food Stamps Example</h3>
        <h4 id="understanding-snap">Understanding SNAP</h4>
        <p>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) affects consumer choices:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>SNAP provides funds specifically for purchasing food.</p></li>
        <li><p>Compare cash transfers versus food stamps.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="budget-constraints-with-snap">Budget Constraints with SNAP</h4>
        <p>When consumers receive cash, the budget constraint shifts outward, allowing more flexibility in choice. For food stamps, the budget constraint may kink, reflecting restrictions on spending.</p>
        <h5 id="mathematical-formulation">Mathematical Formulation</h5>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Cash Transfer Budget : <em>Y</em> + cash → new budget constraint</span><br /></p>
        <h5 id="graph-of-cash-subsidy">Graph of Cash Subsidy</h5>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Initial Budget Line: Runs from <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> (food) to <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> (shelter).</p></li>
        <li><p>Shift with Cash: Budget line shifts from <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> + 500</span>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="comparing-choices">Comparing Choices</h4>
        <p>Two different consumer types:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Person Y: Moves upward on the budget line.</p></li>
        <li><p>Person X: May only gain a slight increment in food but substantially increase their spending on shelter.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding consumer behavior under budget constraints helps to illustrate broader economic theories concerning welfare programs like food stamps. While empirical evidence suggests mixing cash transfers may improve well-being, the paternalistic reasoning for SNAP designs calls into question the nature of consumer choice.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we will derive demand curves using consumer choice theory, discuss the elasticity of demand, the effect of income changes on demand, and analyze the impact of price changes using the substitution and income effects.</p>
        <h3 id="deriving-demand-curves">Deriving Demand Curves</h3>
        <p>We start with the foundational model in consumer choice. The demand for goods can be derived from a utility function.</p>
        <h4 id="example-setup">Example Setup</h4>
        <p>Assume the utility function is of the form: <br /><span class="math display"><em>u</em> = <em>P</em> ⋅ <em>C</em></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> represents cookies, and the price of cookies <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> is given. Let:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Income (<span class="math inline"><em>I</em></span>) = $72</p></li>
        <li><p>Price of pizza (<span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>) = $12</p></li>
        <li><p>Price of cookies (<span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span>) = $6</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="budget-constraints-1">Budget Constraints</h4>
        <p>Define the budget constraint: <br /><span class="math display"><em>B</em><em>C</em> : <em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> ⋅ <em>C</em> + <em>P</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> ⋅ <em>P</em> = <em>I</em></span><br /> For the initial prices:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Maximum cookies when pizza is zero: <span class="math inline"><em>C</em> = 12</span> (at <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0</span>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Maximum pizza when cookies are zero: <span class="math inline"><em>P</em> = 6</span> (at <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> = 0</span>)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If prices change, new budget constraints can be derived as shown in the following figures (placeholders for figures will be identified below):</p>
        <h4 id="graphical-analysis">Graphical Analysis</h4>
        <p>When <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> rises to $9:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>New intercepts: 8 cookies (x-intercept) and 6 pizzas (y-intercept).</p></li>
        <li><p>New budget constraint: <span class="math inline"><em>B</em><em>C</em>2</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The slope of the new budget constraint: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{slope} = -\frac{P_c}{P_p} \rightarrow -\frac{9}{12} = -\frac{3}{4}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>The effect of price changes shows a move from point <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> (6 cookies, 3 pizzas) to point <span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> (4 cookies, 3 pizzas).</p>
        <p>When <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> falls to $4:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>New intercepts indicate an ability to purchase 18 cookies.</p></li>
        <li><p>New budget constraint: <span class="math inline"><em>B</em><em>C</em>3</span></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, the new budget constraint slope: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{slope} = -\frac{4}{12} = -\frac{1}{3}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>This moves from point A to point C (3 pizzas, 9 cookies).</p>
        <h4 id="demand-curves">Demand Curves</h4>
        <p>From these points, a demand curve can be plotted. The demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantity demanded: <br /><span class="math display">Demand Curve: <em>Q</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> = <em>f</em>(<em>P</em>)</span><br /> For instance:</p>

        <h1 id="producer-theory-notes">Producer Theory Notes</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-producer-theory">Introduction to Producer Theory</h3>
        <p>Producer theory expands on consumer theory, moving from the demand curve to the supply curve. While consumer theory primarily dealt with optimizing utility given income and prices, producer theory involves firms that decide their income based on production choices.</p>
        <h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h3>
        <h4 id="production-function">Production Function</h4>
        <p>Producers utilize a <strong>production function</strong> to transform inputs (labor and capital) into output. The general form is:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>q</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>L</em>, <em>K</em>)</span><br /> where:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> = quantity of goods produced (firm-specific)</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> = labor input</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> = capital input</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We differentiate between firm output (<span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>) and market output (<span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>).</p>
        <h4 id="factors-of-production">Factors of Production</h4>
        <p>The inputs in production are categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Labor</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>): Refers to the workers employed.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Capital</strong> (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>): Refers to machines, buildings, and equipment used in production.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inputs can be classified as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Variable Inputs</strong>: Easily changed (e.g., hours worked).</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Fixed Inputs</strong>: Hard to change quickly (e.g., size of a factory).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The distinction between short run and long run is critical:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Short Run</strong>: Some inputs are fixed, typically <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> is fixed and <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> is variable.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Long Run</strong>: All inputs can change; both <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> are variable.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="short-run-production">Short Run Production</h3>
        <p>In the short run, firms aim to maximize profits by hiring labor while keeping capital fixed. The short-run production function can be expressed as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>q</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>L</em>, <em>K̄</em>)</span><br /></p>
        <p>The focus is primarily on <strong>Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)</strong>, which is defined as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$MPL = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>Diminishing marginal product states that as more units of labor are added, the contribution of each additional unit of labor to output eventually decreases.</p>
        <h3 id="long-run-production">Long Run Production</h3>
        <p>In the long run, firms have the flexibility to change both labor and capital. The production function remains similar:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>q</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>L</em>, <em>K</em>)</span><br /></p>
        <p>Firms must decide the optimal mix of labor and capital. The concept of <strong>Isoquants</strong> is used here, representing combinations of labor and capital that yield the same level of output.</p>
        <h4 id="marginal-rate-of-technical-substitution-mrts">Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)</h4>
        <p>The MRTS of labor for capital is defined as the slope of the isoquant:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$MRTS = -\frac{MPL}{MPK}$$</span><br /> where:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>P</em><em>K</em></span> is the marginal product of capital.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="returns-to-scale">Returns to Scale</h4>
        <p>Returns to scale assesses how output responds when all inputs are increased proportionally:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Constant Returns to Scale</strong>: Doubling inputs leads to double the output.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Increasing Returns to Scale</strong>: Doubling inputs leads to more than double the output.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Decreasing Returns to Scale</strong>: Doubling inputs leads to less than double the output.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="productivity-and-its-implications">Productivity and Its Implications</h3>
        <h4 id="total-factor-productivity-tfp">Total Factor Productivity (TFP)</h4>
        <p>Productivity is defined as the efficiency of converting inputs into outputs, which can be influenced by innovations in production processes:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>q</em> = <em>A</em> ⋅ <em>f</em>(<em>L</em>, <em>K</em>)</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> signifies the total factor productivity at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
        <h4 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h4>

        To derive the cost function, replace <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> using the production function:<br />
        <br />
        1. From <span class="math inline">$q = \sqrt{L \cdot K}$</span>, we can isolate <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>: <br /><span class="math display">$$L = \frac{q^2}{K}$$</span><br /><br />
        2. Substitute <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> into the cost function: <br /><span class="math display">$$C = r \cdot K + w \cdot \left(\frac{q^2}{K}\right) = 10K + 5 \frac{q^2}{K}$$</span><br /></p>

        <li><p>Long-run cost curves are everywhere lower than short-run cost curves since firms can adjust their capital structure optimally.</p></li>

        <h3 id="conclusion-5">Conclusion</h3>

        <li><p><strong>Income Changes</strong>: An increase in consumer income generally shifts the demand for normal goods to the right.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Changes in Prices of Related Goods</strong>: If the price of a complementary good rises, the demand for the associated good may decrease.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Market Size</strong>: An increase in market size (more consumers) shifts the demand curve to the right.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Expectations of Future Prices</strong>: If consumers anticipate a price increase, they may buy more now.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="supply-curve-shifts">Supply Curve Shifts</h4>
        <p>Supply curves can shift due to:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Changes in Input Costs</strong>: Increases in the costs of production shift the supply curve to the left.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Technological Advancements</strong>: Improvements in technology usually lead to more efficient production, causing the supply curve to shift to the right.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="example-scenarios">Example Scenarios</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Change in consumer tastes towards SUVs increases the demand for gasoline, shifting demand right (<span class="math inline"><em>D</em><sub>1</sub> → <em>D</em><sub>2</sub></span>), leading to excess demand and higher prices.</p></li>
        <li><p>War in oil-producing regions raises production costs, shifting the supply curve left (<span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub>1</sub> → <em>S</em><sub>2</sub></span>), which increases prices and reduces quantity sold.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="consumer-surplus">Consumer Surplus</h3>
        <p>Consumer surplus is defined as the benefit that consumers receive when they pay a price lower than what they are willing to pay. It can be represented graphically as: <br /><span class="math display">Consumer Surplus = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup><em>Q</em><sup>*</sup></sup>(<em>D</em>(<em>Q</em>) − <em>P</em>) <em>d</em><em>Q</em></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> is the market price and <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sup>*</sup></span> is the equilibrium quantity.</p>
        <h4 id="graphical-representation-1">Graphical Representation</h4>
        <p>The consumer surplus is visually represented by the area above the price level and below the demand curve. If demand is perfectly inelastic, consumer surplus can become infinite as consumers are willing to pay anything for the good.</p>
        <h3 id="producer-surplus">Producer Surplus</h3>
        <p>Producer surplus is the difference between what producers are willing to accept for a good and what they actually receive, mathematically represented as: <br /><span class="math display">Producer Surplus = <em>P</em> − <em>C</em>(<em>Q</em>)</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em>(<em>Q</em>)</span> represents the marginal cost of production. The producer surplus is visually represented by the area below the price level and above the supply curve.</p>
        <h4 id="market-producer-surplus">Market Producer Surplus</h4>
        <p>The total producer surplus in the market can be found by aggregating the surpluses across all firms: <br /><span class="math display">Total Producer Surplus = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup><em>Q</em><sup>*</sup></sup>(<em>P</em> − <em>S</em>(<em>Q</em>)) <em>d</em><em>Q</em></span><br /></p>

        <h1 id="notes-on-monopolies">Notes on Monopolies</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-7">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Monopolies are one extreme on the market structure spectrum, contrasting with perfectly competitive firms which face a perfectly elastic demand curve and can sell at market price. Monopolists, on the other hand, can set prices but undersupply, resulting in deadweight loss.</p>
        <h3 id="sources-of-monopoly">Sources of Monopoly</h3>
        <p>Monopolies arise from two primary sources:</p>
        <h4 id="cost-advantages">Cost Advantages</h4>
        <p>Some monopolies stem from inherent cost advantages in the market. These can occur when:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A firm controls a crucial input (e.g., a unique resource).</p></li>
        <li><p>The average cost of production declines with increasing output, making it unfeasible for additional firms to enter the market.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="natural-monopoly">Natural Monopoly</h5>
        <p>A natural monopoly exists when:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>One firm can produce at a lower average cost than multiple firms for all relevant output levels.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This occurs typically in industries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs (e.g., water utilities). The average cost in such scenarios typically declines due to high initial fixed costs that are spread over a larger quantity of output.</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$AC = \frac{FC + VC(Q)}{Q}$$</span><br /> Where <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><em>C</em></span> is fixed cost, <span class="math inline"><em>V</em><em>C</em></span> is variable cost, and <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> is quantity produced.</p>
        <h4 id="government-action">Government Action</h4>
        <p>Governments can also create monopolies through various means. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Granting <strong>patents</strong>, which provide inventors exclusive rights to produce and sell new products for a specified period (20 years).</p></li>
        <li><p>Licensing and regulation that create barriers to entry in certain markets.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deadweight loss arising from monopolies can be illustrated by the following equation: <br /><span class="math display">$$DWL = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (P_m - MC) \cdot (Q_c - Q_m)$$</span><br /> Where <span class="math inline"><em>P</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> is the monopolist’s price, <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>C</em></span> is marginal cost, <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> is the competitive quantity, and <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> is the monopolist’s quantity.</p>
        <h3 id="regulating-monopolies">Regulating Monopolies</h3>
        <p>Regulation can have different effects on monopolistic markets. One approach is to set price ceilings to mimic competitive outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A price ceiling may eliminate deadweight loss by ensuring that monopolists produce closer to the competitive output level.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, practical challenges arise:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Information Asymmetry</strong>: Regulators may lack crucial information about demand and supply curves, making it difficult to set appropriate prices.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Market Failures</strong>: Inefficiencies may still persist if the government misestimates competitive prices, leading to larger deadweight losses.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="contestable-markets">Contestable Markets</h4>
        <p>A concept termed "contestable markets" refers to scenarios where a monopoly can exist but without significant market power due to the low barriers to entry. If firms can easily enter and exit the market, this may limit the monopolist’s pricing power despite a single firm operating in the market.</p>
        <h3 id="case-study-airline-deregulation">Case Study: Airline Deregulation</h3>
        <p>Historically, following the deregulation of the airline industry:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Fares dropped significantly (approx. 1/3).</p></li>
        <li><p>More routes became available.</p></li>
        <li><p>Quality of the flying experience deteriorated, with reduced amenities.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Illustrating the outcomes, we find that:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Cheaper flights.</p></li>
        <li><p>Increased competition led to lower average costs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Creation of the hub-and-spoke model by airlines, resulting in some monopolistic behaviors at airports.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="conclusion-9">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Monopolies can arise legitimately through cost advantages or government action, as seen with natural monopolies and patents. While regulation can address monopolistic inefficiencies, it faces practical challenges. Contestable markets present an interesting dimension where monopoly does not necessarily mean market power. The discussion on airline deregulation exemplifies these concepts and their real-world implications.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-8">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The lecture discusses the market structure of oligopoly, which is characterized by a small number of firms competing with each other, unlike perfect competition or monopoly. Oligopoly markets are marked by barriers to entry that prevent unlimited firms from entering the market.</p>
        <h3 id="key-concepts-2">Key Concepts</h3>
        <h4 id="oligopoly">Oligopoly</h4>
        <p>An oligopoly is defined as a market structure wherein:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>There are a few firms competing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Barriers to entry prevent many firms from entering the market.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example of an oligopoly is the automobile industry, controlled by a handful of major manufacturers.</p>
        <h4 id="cooperative-vs-non-cooperative-behavior">Cooperative vs Non-Cooperative Behavior</h4>
        <p>Within oligopoly markets, firms can behave either cooperatively (forming a cartel) or non-cooperatively:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Cooperative Behavior:</strong> Firms may form a cartel, such as OPEC, which behaves like a monopoly by controlling outputs to keep prices high.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Non-Cooperative Behavior:</strong> Firms compete against each other, potentially leading to lower profits, resembling a competitive market.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="game-theory">Game Theory</h4>
        <p>Game theory is the mathematical study of interaction among rational decision-makers. In non-cooperative oligopolies, the Nash equilibrium is a primary concept: <br /><span class="math display">Nash Equilibrium:   No player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies of others.</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="prisoners-dilemma">Prisoner’s Dilemma</h3>
        <p>A classic example to illustrate non-cooperativity in game theory is the Prisoner’s Dilemma. The payoff matrix for two prisoners is structured as follows:</p>
        <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr class="odd">
        <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;">(1, 1)</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;">(5, 0)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="even">
        <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
        <td style="text-align: center;">(0, 5)</td>
        <td style="text-align: center;">(2, 2)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Where the outcome represents years in prison:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Both remain silent: each gets 1 year.</p></li>
        <li><p>One talks: the talker goes free, the other goes to prison for 5 years.</p></li>
        <li><p>Both talk: each gets 2 years.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players choose to talk, leading to a suboptimal outcome.</p>
        <h3 id="application-to-economics">Application to Economics</h3>
        <p>Focusing on advertising strategies between two companies, for instance, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, involves similar logic. Assuming:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If both advertise, they will incur specific costs leading to lower profits.</p></li>
        <li><p>If one advertises while the other does not, the advertiser stands to gain significantly.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The equilibrium is then created where: <br /><span class="math display">If <em>q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> is Coca-Cola’s output and <em>q</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> is Pepsi’s, then:</span><br /> <br /><span class="math display">Revenue<sub><em>C</em></sub> = <em>P</em> ⋅ <em>q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> = (339 − <em>q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> − <em>q</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>)<em>q</em><sub><em>C</em></sub></span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="cournot-model">Cournot Model</h3>
        <p>The Cournot model describes a non-cooperative oligopoly where firms compete in quantities. The setup involves:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Two firms, maximizing their profit based on their choices and the choices of their competitor.</p></li>

        <p>Given a demand function <span class="math inline"><em>P</em> = 339 − <em>Q</em></span> (where <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em> = <em>q</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> + <em>q</em><sub><em>U</em></sub></span>), where <span class="math inline"><em>q</em><sub><em>A</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>q</em><sub><em>U</em></sub></span> represent the output of American and United Airlines, respectively, the profit-maximizing conditions can be derived: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
            \text{Revenue}_A &amp;= P \cdot q_A = (339 - (q_A + q_U)) q_A \\

            \text{Set MR equal to MC } (147): &amp;\quad 339 - 2q_A - q_U = 147\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>This leads to the best response functions: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

        <p>Solving the above simultaneous equations will yield the Cournot equilibrium quantities for both firms.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-10">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The lecture emphasizes the importance of game theory in understanding oligopoly behavior. The Cournot model serves as a crucial analytical framework by illustrating how firms strategically interact in an oligopoly setting.</p>
        <h1 id="notes-on-oligopoly-and-cartels">Notes on Oligopoly and Cartels</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-oligopoly">Introduction to Oligopoly</h3>
        <p>In the study of oligopoly, we distinguish between cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria. A key concept in achieving better outcomes in oligopolistic markets is cooperation among firms, often manifesting as cartels.</p>
        <h3 id="cartels-and-cooperative-outcomes">Cartels and Cooperative Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Consider the example of two firms (American Airlines and United Airlines). We previously analyzed the demand curve for this market: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em> = 339 − <em>Q</em></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> is price and <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span> is the quantity of flights.</p>
        <p>The marginal cost <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>C</em></span> for both firms is given as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>M</em><em>C</em> = 147</span><br /></p>
        <p>In a monopoly situation (considered as a cooperative equilibrium), the monopolist’s marginal revenue <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>R</em></span> can be calculated as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>M</em><em>R</em> = 339 − 2<em>Q</em></span><br /> Setting <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>R</em> = <em>M</em><em>C</em></span>: <br /><span class="math display">339 − 2<em>Q</em> = 147</span><br /> Solving for <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em></span>: <br /><span class="math display"><em>Q</em> = 96</span><br /> The optimal price then, from the demand curve: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em> = 339 − 96 = 243</span><br /></p>
        <p>When these firms cooperate by becoming a cartel, each firm operates at: <br /><span class="math display"><em>Q</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> = <em>Q</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = 48</span><br /> Total profits for each firm can be expressed as: <br /><span class="math display">Profit = <em>Q</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> × (<em>P</em> − <em>M</em><em>C</em>) = 48 × (243 − 147) = 4, 608</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="non-cooperative-equilibrium">Non-Cooperative Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>In a non-cooperative outcome where each firm operates independently, the total quantity offered can be represented as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>Q</em> = 64</span><br /> The price would thus be: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em> = 339 − 128 = 211</span><br /> Calculating profits under non-cooperation: <br /><span class="math display">Profit = 64 × (211 − 147) = 4, 096</span><br /></p>
        <p>We see that cooperation improves profits by $512, or approximately 12.5%$.</p>
        <h4 id="why-dont-cartels-form">Why Don’t Cartels Form?</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Instability of Cartels</strong>: Firms in a cartel have an incentive to cheat, maximizing their individual profits by increasing output. If one firm cheats and increases quantity, the market price decreases.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Illegality</strong>: Cartels are illegal in many jurisdictions, reducing the incentive to form them.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="game-theory-and-cartel-instability">Game Theory and Cartel Instability</h3>
        <p>When a firm, say American Airlines, decides to cheat by increasing its flights to <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> = 50</span>, the market price adjusts: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em> = 339 − 98 = 241</span><br /> New profits for American Airlines: <br /><span class="math display">Profit = 50 × (241 − 147) = 4, 700</span><br /> And for United Airlines: <br /><span class="math display">Profit = 48 × (241 − 147) = 4, 512</span><br /> This scenario leads to decreased total market profits and eventually leads to the breakdown of the cartel.</p>
        <h3 id="antitrust-laws">Antitrust Laws</h3>
        <p>Antitrust legislation exists to prevent firms from engaging in cartel behavior. Historical examples include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The movie industry’s monopolization via ownership of theaters, resulting in federal lawsuits.</p></li>
        <li><p>Past airline industry collusion attempts and their legal repercussions.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="government-made-cartels">Government-Made Cartels</h4>
        <p>Countries can also create cartels, as seen with Japan’s voluntary export restraint in the 1980s, leading to elevated prices for vehicles in the U.S.</p>
        <h3 id="comparing-market-structures">Comparing Market Structures</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Monopolistic outcomes yield high profits and lower quantities sold, while perfect competition results in zero profits and higher quantities.</p></li>
        <li><p>The intermediate oligopoly structure results in moderately high profits and quantities.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="cournot-vs.-bertrand-competition">Cournot vs. Bertrand Competition</h3>
        <h4 id="cournot-competition">Cournot Competition</h4>
        <p>In Cournot competition, firms fix quantities: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em> = <em>M</em><em>C</em>  (<em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em> <em>c</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>v</em><em>e</em> <em>e</em><em>q</em><em>u</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>u</em><em>m</em>)</span><br /> As the number of firms, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, increases, the markup reduces. The relationship can be expressed as: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Markup} \approx -\frac{1}{n}\text{(elasticity of demand)}$$</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="bertrand-competition">Bertrand Competition</h4>
        <p>In Bertrand competition, firms are price competitors. Notably:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Only two firms are needed to drive prices to marginal cost.</p></li>
        <li><p>This leads to a lower overall markup and can be more beneficial to consumers.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="product-differentiation">Product Differentiation</h3>
        <p>Firms and producers strive to differentiate their products in Bertrand competition settings. This differentiation enables them to maintain higher prices and potential for increased profits despite competition.</p>
        <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Cereals have evolved into a variety of products, creating a dense market of over 5,000 brands.</p></li>
        <li><p>Brand loyalty, such as between Nike and Adidas, can lead to higher prices and differentials in perceived product quality.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-11">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding the dynamics of oligopolies, cartels, and different competition models allows economists and policymakers to make informed decisions that balance the needs of consumers against the interests of businesses.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Each additional worker adds less to total output.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="long-run-labor-demand">Long Run Labor Demand</h3>
        <p>In the long run, both labor and capital can adjust. Long-run labor demand is more elastic as firms can optimize both inputs.</p>
        <h4 id="comparison-with-short-run">Comparison with Short Run</h4>
        <p>Two short-run demand curves at different levels of capital highlight the flexibility in long-run optimization.</p>
        <h3 id="capital-demand">Capital Demand</h3>

        <p>This indicates:</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-to-factor-markets-1">Introduction to Factor Markets</h3>
        <p>Today, we discuss factor markets with a focus on the labor market and the implications of a minimum wage.</p>
        <h3 id="labor-market-equilibrium">Labor Market Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>In the labor market, we examine the supply and demand for labor, considering workers’ decisions between work and leisure.</p>
        <h4 id="equilibrium-1">Equilibrium</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Let <span class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub>1</sub></span> be the equilibrium quantity of labor supplied with wage <span class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Supply curve (<span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>): typically upward sloping, although it can be backward-bending if income effects dominate substitution effects.</p></li>
        <li><p>Demand curve (<span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span>): typically downward sloping due to diminishing marginal productivity.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="minimum-wage">Minimum Wage</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A minimum wage <span class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub>2</sub></span> set above the market wage <span class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub>1</sub></span> creates a binding constraint.</p></li>
        <li><p>Workers desire to supply <span class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> amount of labor at <span class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub>2</sub></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Firms will demand only <span class="math inline"><em>L</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span> labor characterized by the condition: <br /><span class="math display"><em>W</em> = <em>M</em><em>R</em><em>P</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>R</em><em>P</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span> is the marginal revenue product of labor.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="welfare-implications">Welfare Implications</h5>
        <p>Consumer surplus for firms and producer surplus for workers is affected:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Before minimum wage: <br /><span class="math display">Firms’ surplus = <em>A</em> + <em>B</em> + <em>C</em>,  Workers’ surplus = <em>D</em> + <em>E</em></span><br /></p></li>
        <li><p>After minimum wage:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Consumer surplus is reduced; some surplus is transferred to workers</p></li>
        <li><p>Deadweight loss due to fewer jobs: <span class="math inline"><em>C</em> + <em>E</em></span></p></li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, applying a minimum wage may increase worker welfare but decrease overall social welfare.</p>
        <h3 id="empirical-evidence-on-minimum-wage">Empirical Evidence on Minimum Wage</h3>
        <p>Various studies have shown that employment levels in states raising the minimum wage do not significantly decrease:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Example: Analysis of New Jersey vs. Pennsylvania fast-food workers showed no significant drop in employment in New Jersey after minimum wage increase.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="explanations">Explanations</h4>
        <p>Three potential explanations for finding no decrease in employment:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Minimum wage not binding.</p></li>
        <li><p>Labor supply is perfectly inelastic.</p></li>
        <li><p>Non-competitive labor markets (monopsony).</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="monopsony-in-labor-markets">Monopsony in Labor Markets</h3>
        <p>In a monopsony:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Firms have market power over workers.</p></li>
        <li><p>Wage paid is below marginal revenue product of labor, represented as:</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>W</em> &lt; <em>M</em><em>R</em><em>P</em><sub><em>L</em></sub></span><br /></p>
        <p>With a binding minimum wage above what workers earn in a monopsony market, firms may not fire workers due to: <br /><span class="math display"><em>M</em><em>R</em><em>P</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> &gt; <em>W</em><sub><em>m</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub></span><br /> The result is a mere transfer of surplus from the firm to the worker without deadweight loss.</p>
        <h3 id="capital-markets">Capital Markets</h3>
        <h4 id="definition-of-capital">Definition of Capital</h4>
        <p>Capital represents the diversion of current consumption towards future consumption. Its forms include buildings, machines, and financial instruments.</p>
        <h4 id="equilibrium-in-capital-markets">Equilibrium in Capital Markets</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Demand for capital comes from the marginal revenue product of capital <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>R</em><em>P</em><sub><em>K</em></sub></span>.</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h5 id="interest-rate">Interest Rate</h5>
        <p>The equilibrium interest rate reflects the interaction between the demand for capital and the supply provided by savers.</p>
        <h4 id="intertemporal-choice">Intertemporal Choice</h4>
        <p>Intertemporal choice concerns how much to consume today versus tomorrow, typically modeled as: - Present Consumption (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>1</sub></span>) vs. Future Consumption (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>2</sub></span>) <br /><span class="math display">$$C_2 = \frac{C_1 (1 + r)}{1}$$</span><br /> Where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the interest rate.</p>
        <h5 id="effects-of-interest-rate-changes">Effects of Interest Rate Changes</h5>
        <p>If the interest rate rises:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>The opportunity cost of consuming today increases (substitution effect).</p></li>
        <li><p>Higher interest income may lead to increased wealth (income effect).</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The net effect on consumption today and saving can be ambiguous.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-13">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>These discussions on labor and capital markets reveal the complexities of economic principles such as minimum wage impacts and intertemporal choices in savings. Future discussions will delve into further aspects of capital markets.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-to-factor-markets-2">Introduction to Factor Markets</h3>
        <p>We continue our discussion of factor markets, focusing on how capital markets impact real-world decisions. Key concepts include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Firms finance capital through a pool of savings from individuals.</p></li>
        <li><p>Individuals make choices about consumption and savings over time.</p></li>
        <li><p>Firms borrow from these savings at an interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> to decide on investments.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="present-value">Present Value</h3>
        <p>Present value (PV) is a core concept in evaluating investments over time, which states:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^t}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>where:</p>

        <li><p><span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> = Number of periods until the payment</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key insight is: $1 received tomorrow is worth less than $1 received today because it can be invested.</p>
        <h4 id="multiple-period-payments">Multiple Period Payments</h4>
        <p>For a stream of future cash flows <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> over <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> periods:</p>

        <p>For example, if <span class="math inline"><em>C</em> = 10</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> = 0.1</span>, the present value is:</p>

        <h3 id="future-value">Future Value</h3>

        <p>This means if you save an amount today, it will grow over time due to interest compounding, demonstrating the critical concept of earning interest on interest.</p>
        <h4 id="example-of-saving">Example of Saving</h4>
        <p>Consider two saving plans:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Plan 1: Save $3,000 annually for the first 15 years, stop saving, and let it grow.</p></li>
        <li><p>Plan 2: Start saving $3,000 annually after 15 years.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plan 1 may yield a significantly higher amount due to compounding over time.</p>
        <h3 id="impact-of-inflation">Impact of Inflation</h3>
        <p>Inflation affects the real value of money over time. The nominal interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> can be adjusted to find the real interest rate <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>r</em> = <em>i</em> − <em>π</em></span><br /></p>
        <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> is the inflation rate. This adjustment is crucial in decision-making:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>If inflation rises, the purchasing power of returns decreases, altering investment value assessments.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="decision-making-under-inflation">Decision Making under Inflation</h4>
        <p>For a savings decision of $100 at a nominal interest rate of 10%, with 10% inflation, the real interest rate is zero:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>F</em><em>V</em><sub>adjusted</sub> = 100 × (1 + <em>i</em>) = 110</span><br /></p>
        <p>In this situation, any future gains must be assessed with respect to what they can purchase.</p>
        <h3 id="investment-decisions-net-present-value">Investment Decisions: Net Present Value</h3>
        <p>Firms evaluate investment opportunities through net present value (NPV), calculated as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{(R_t - C_t)}{(1+i)^t}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the revenue received, and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the costs incurred. Investments are pursued if <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><em>P</em><em>V</em> &gt; 0</span>.</p>
        <h4 id="relation-to-interest-rates">Relation to Interest Rates</h4>
        <p>Higher interest rates decrease NPV because they increase the discount applied to future cash flows, making investments less attractive. Thus, firms may choose to hold cash rather than invest.</p>
        <h3 id="opportunity-cost-and-firm-decision-making">Opportunity Cost and Firm Decision Making</h3>
        <p>When a firm considers investment, they must consider the opportunity cost:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>What would I earn by choosing the next best investment? This informs the discount rate used in PV calculations.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="human-capital-investment-the-college-decision">Human Capital Investment: The College Decision</h3>
        <p>Investing in education is akin to other investments, with costs and benefits evaluated over time.</p>
        <h4 id="evaluating-the-college-investment">Evaluating the College Investment</h4>
        <p>Assuming:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>College costs $35,000 per year for 4 years.</p></li>
        <li><p>High school graduates earn $20,000, while college graduates earn $45,000 starting.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The opportunity costs include future earnings sacrificed alongside the immediate costs of college. The NPV of the human capital investment is influenced by interest rates, and potential earnings growth emphasizes this investment’s long-term nature.</p>
        <p>Finally, the decision regarding college education is an investment in human capital that should be evaluated using present value principles, taking into account all costs and potential returns.</p>
        <h1 id="notes-on-savings-and-international-trade">Notes on Savings and International Trade</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-savings">Introduction to Savings</h3>
        <p>Savings is a critically important element of economic growth. An increase in savings leads to an increase in the capital supply, shifting the capital supply curve outward. This can be represented graphically as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Capital Supply ↑  ⟹ Interest Rates↓</span><br /></p>
        <p>As the interest rates fall, the Net Present Value (NPV) of investments increases:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{NPV} = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is cash flow, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the interest rate, and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is the time period.</p>
        <p>With lower interest rates, firms are incentivized to invest more, thus fostering economic growth.</p>
        <h3 id="savings-rates">Savings Rates</h3>
        <p>The current U.S. savings rate is between 3% to 5%, significantly lower than Europe and Japan’s rates of over 15%. To encourage savings, public policies include tax incentives for retirement savings, such as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Employer-sponsored pensions</p></li>
        <li><p>401(k) plans</p></li>
        <li><p>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taxation on savings, represented as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">After-tax return = <em>r</em> × (1 − <em>τ</em>)</span><br /></p>
        <p>where <span class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span> is the tax rate.</p>
        <p>The advantage of tax-deferred savings accounts is clear: delaying taxation allows for compound interest to accrue more effectively.</p>
        <h3 id="investment-strategies">Investment Strategies</h3>
        <p>Common investment options in a 401(k) include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Money Market Funds: Invest in government securities with low yields (approx. 1-3%).</p></li>
        <li><p>Bond Funds: Invest in corporate bonds, generally yielding 4% to 5%.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stock Funds: Higher risk but higher potential returns (approx. 7%).</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The risk-return trade-off states that riskier investments tend to yield higher returns.</p>
        <h3 id="diversification">Diversification</h3>
        <p>The key recommendation is diversification. Avoid putting all your savings into your employer’s stock due to the risk of losing both your job and your investment.</p>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-international-trade">Introduction to International Trade</h3>
        <p>International trade involves the exchange of goods and services across nations, consisting of exports (goods sold to other countries) and imports (goods bought from other countries). The U.S. currently has a trade deficit, notable at around $800 billion.</p>
        <h4 id="trade-deficits-and-surpluses">Trade Deficits and Surpluses</h4>
        <p>A trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. For example, trading one Pikachu for one Jigglypuff creates a Pikachu deficit but enhances the overall welfare of both parties involved.</p>
        <h3 id="comparative-advantage">Comparative Advantage</h3>
        <p>The concept of comparative advantage is vital for understanding international trade. It is based on the idea that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>A country should specialize in goods it can produce at a lower opportunity cost than other countries.</p></li>
        <li><p>Even if one country is more efficient in the production of both goods, they should still specialize in the good for which they have the comparative advantage.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if the U.S. is better at producing computers and Colombia is better at producing roses, we can express this as:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Opportunity Cost of Computers in U.S. &lt; Opportunity Cost of Computers in Colombia</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="production-possibility-frontier-ppf">Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)</h3>
        <p>The PPF illustrates the maximum possible output combinations of two goods that can be produced using available resources. For two countries, the PPF can be depicted with the following equations, assuming linearity for simplicity:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">U.S. PPF: Computers = 2000 − 0.5 × Roses</span><br /></p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Colombia PPF: Roses = 2000 − 2 × Computers</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="shifts-in-ppf-due-to-trade">Shifts in PPF due to Trade</h4>
        <p>When trade is allowed, each country specializes in the production of the good they have a comparative advantage in, resulting in increased total output. This leads to new consumption possibilities outside the initial PPF bounds.</p>
        <p>For example, if the U.S. only produces computers and Colombia only produces roses, the new total production could be represented with a new combined world PPF:</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">New World Outputs: 2000 Computers, 2000 Roses</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-14">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>International trade enhances overall efficiency and expands the production possibilities for participating countries. The trade-off is between the welfare of consumers benefiting from cheaper imports and producers who may lose jobs due to increased competition from abroad.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Some countries have an abundance of certain resources (e.g., Canada’s forests for lumber).</p></li>
        <li><p>Labor costs are a critical factor, explaining why textiles are often produced in countries with cheaper labor.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Technological advancements can create comparative advantages (e.g., Japan’s automotive industry).</p></li>

        </ol>
        <h3 id="welfare-implications-of-international-trade">Welfare Implications of International Trade</h3>
        <p>Economists advocate for international trade due to its positive effects on welfare.</p>
        <h4 id="consumer-and-producer-surplus-1">Consumer and Producer Surplus</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><p>In a domestic market for roses:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Consumer Surplus (CS) before trade is determined by the area under the demand curve above the price level.</p></li>
        <li><p>Producer Surplus (PS) is the area above the supply curve and below the price.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>When trade is introduced at a lower world price, the market adjusts:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Increased consumer surplus due to lower prices.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduced producer surplus.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Total welfare gain can be visualized as the area gained by consumers minus the area lost by producers.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="gains-from-trade">Gains from Trade</h4>
        <p>When comparing before and after trade:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>With imports: Total roses consumed increases, domestic production decreases, but overall social surplus rises.</p></li>
        <li><p>With exports: The opposite occurs, yet total welfare generally increases.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Total Social Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus</span><br /></p>

        <h3 id="introduction-10">Introduction</h3>
        <p>The focus of this lecture is on decision making under uncertainty, a topic we have not extensively covered yet. Previous models assumed full knowledge and certainty when making decisions, however, many real-world decisions involve uncertainty. This leads us to introduce the concept of <strong>Expected Utility Theory</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="uncertainty-in-decision-making">Uncertainty in Decision Making</h3>
        <h4 id="examples-of-uncertainty">Examples of Uncertainty</h4>
        <p>1. Studying for a Final Exam:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>In previous models, students could optimize their studying based on known probabilities of topics on the exam. In reality, students face uncertainty regarding what will be tested and must decide how to allocate their study time accordingly.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Everyday Decisions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Decisions like bringing an umbrella, betting on sports, or making significant life choices (e.g., mortgages, insurance) involve inherent uncertainty.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="expected-utility-theory">Expected Utility Theory</h4>
        <p>Expected Utility Theory provides a way to approach decisions where outcomes are uncertain. It is grounded in the notion that what individuals care about is not the monetary outcome but the <strong>utility</strong> derived from that outcome.</p>
        <h3 id="risk-expected-value-and-expected-utility">Risk, Expected Value, and Expected Utility</h3>
        <h4 id="expected-value-calculation">Expected Value Calculation</h4>
        <p>The formula for expected value (EV) of a gamble can be expressed as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>V</em> = <em>P</em>(Win) × Value if Win + <em>P</em>(Lose) × Value if Lose</span><br /></p>
        <h4 id="expected-utility">Expected Utility</h4>
        <p>Expected Utility (EU) modifies the expected value to account for individual preferences: <br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>U</em> = <em>P</em>(Win) × <em>U</em>(Value if Win) + <em>P</em>(Lose) × <em>U</em>(Value if Lose)</span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> represents the utility function.</p>
        <h4 id="diminishing-marginal-utility">Diminishing Marginal Utility</h4>
        <p>Utility is often characterized by diminishing marginal utility:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Additional units of wealth provide less additional utility (hence the utility curve is concave).</p></li>
        <li><p>Losing $1 is felt more strongly than gaining $1, illustrating risk aversion.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="example-coin-flip-bet">Example: Coin Flip Bet</h3>
        <p>Consider a gamble where:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Heads: Win $125</p></li>
        <li><p>Tails: Lose $100</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Analyzing the expected value: <br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>V</em> = 0.5 × 125 + 0.5 × ( − 100) = 12.5</span><br /> Despite having a positive expected value, we must consider expected utility.<br />
        Let’s assume the utility function is <span class="math inline">$U(c) = \sqrt{c}$</span>.<br />
        If starting consumption <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub>0</sub> = 100</span>,</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Winning leads to <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub> = 225</span> (<span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(225) = 15</span>)</p></li>
        <li><p>Losing leads to <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><em>e</em></sub> = 0</span> (<span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(0) = 0</span>)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Calculating expected utility: <br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>U</em> = 0.5 × <em>U</em>(225) + 0.5 × <em>U</em>(0) = 0.5 × 15 + 0.5 × 0 = 7.5</span><br /></p>
        <p>Given <span class="math inline"><em>E</em><em>U</em> &lt; <em>U</em>(<em>c</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>, it’s rational to decline the bet, demonstrating risk aversion.</p>
        <h3 id="risk-preferences">Risk Preferences</h3>
        <h4 id="risk-averse-risk-neutral-risk-loving">Risk Averse, Risk Neutral, Risk Loving</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Risk Averse: Prefers certain outcomes over risky ones. Displays diminishing marginal utility.</p></li>
        <li><p>Risk Neutral: Indifferent to risk, where expected utility equals expected value.</p></li>
        <li><p>Risk Loving: Prefers risky outcomes, possessing increasing marginal utility.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The nature of these preferences can change based on the size of the gamble relative to wealth.</p>
        <h4 id="willingness-to-pay-for-insurance">Willingness to Pay for Insurance</h4>
        <p>People are willing to pay a risk premium to avoid uncertainty. The utility with and without insurance can be formulated as:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Expected utility without insurance:</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>U</em><sub><em>n</em><em>o</em> <em>i</em><em>n</em><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>c</em><em>e</em></sub> = <em>P</em>(No Accident)<em>U</em>(<em>c</em><sub>0</sub>) + <em>P</em>(Accident)<em>U</em>(<em>c</em><sub>0</sub> − Cost of Accident)</span><br /></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Expected utility with insurance, priced at <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>:</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><br /><span class="math display"><em>E</em><em>U</em><sub><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>c</em><em>e</em></sub> = <em>U</em>(<em>c</em><sub>0</sub> − <em>x</em>)</span><br /> Setting these equal allows us to solve for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, providing an understanding of risk premiums.</p>
        <h3 id="applications-insurance-and-lotteries">Applications: Insurance and Lotteries</h3>
        <h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>
        <p>Insurance is driven by risk aversion, with individuals willing to pay more than expected costs to secure peace of mind against unforeseen events.</p>
        <h4 id="lottery-participation">Lottery Participation</h4>
        <p>Despite the negative expected value (e.g., spending $1 with an expected payout significantly less than that), people still participate in lotteries. Theories for this behavior include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Entertainment Value: People enjoy the thrill of anticipation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ignorance: Many underestimate the odds against them.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="conclusion-16">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding decision making under uncertainty through expected utility and associated concepts like risk aversion is crucial for both theoretical and practical applications. Future discussions could include behavioral economics, further exploring human psychology in economic decision-making.</p>

        <li><p>The social welfare function represents society’s collective well-being, often described as: <br /><span class="math display"><em>W</em> = <em>U</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>U</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>U</em><sub>3</sub> + … + <em>U</em><sub><em>N</em></sub></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> is social welfare and <span class="math inline"><em>U</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the utility of individual <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Utilitarian Social Welfare Function</strong>: A straightforward approach where each individual’s utility is summed. This approach treats everyone equally, regardless of their initial condition.</p>

        <h3 id="introduction-11">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This lecture discusses the trade-offs between equity and efficiency, particularly in relation to taxation and redistribution policies in the United States. It highlights several economic principles, including tax incidence, the elasticity of demand and supply, and the implications of different taxation systems.</p>
        <h3 id="equity-efficiency-trade-off-1">Equity-Efficiency Trade-off</h3>
        <p>The equity-efficiency trade-off emphasizes the inherent tension between redistributing wealth (equity) and maintaining economic efficiency. Redistribution via taxation can generate what is known as a "leaky bucket," where some resources are lost in the process.</p>
        <h4 id="leaky-bucket">Leaky Bucket</h4>
        <p>This analogy illustrates inefficiencies in taxing individuals (raising money) and transferring funds (distributing money). The fundamental idea is that while aiming for fairness requires taxpayer money, the actual implementation can reduce overall economic welfare.</p>
        <h3 id="taxation-in-the-us">Taxation in the US</h3>
        <p>When analyzing taxation in the US, two key aspects emerge:</p>
        <h4 id="who-bears-the-taxes-tax-incidence">Who Bears the Taxes? (Tax Incidence)</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Tax incidence refers to the analysis of the effects of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare.</p></li>
        <li><p>A crucial insight is that the burden of the tax can differ from the party that pays it.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="example-tax-on-gasoline">Example: Tax on Gasoline</h4>
        <p>Let us examine a $0.50 per gallon tax imposed on gasoline suppliers with an original price of $1.50, resulting in: <br /><span class="math display">Original Quantity = 100 billion gallons</span><br /> After the tax, the price consumers pay increases to $1.80, leading to a new quantity supplied of: <br /><span class="math display">New Quantity = 90 billion gallons</span><br /></p>
        <p>This yields: - Consumer Burden: <br /><span class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>P</em><sub>consumers</sub> = <em>P</em><sub>new</sub> − <em>P</em><sub>old</sub> = 1.80 − 1.50 = 0.30</span><br /> - Producer Burden: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em><sub>received</sub> = <em>P</em><sub>new</sub> − tax = 1.80 − 0.50 = 1.30  ⇒  <em>Δ</em><em>P</em><sub>producers</sub> = 1.50 − 1.30 = 0.20</span><br /> Thus, consumers bear part of the tax burden ($0.30), while producers bear $0.20.</p>
        <h3 id="tax-wedge">Tax Wedge</h3>
        <p>The tax wedge is defined as the difference between what buyers pay and what sellers receive after tax: <br /><span class="math display">Tax Wedge = <em>P</em><sub>new</sub> − (<em>P</em><sub>new</sub> − tax) = 0.50</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="elasticities-and-tax-incidence">Elasticities and Tax Incidence</h3>
        <p>The effects of a tax depend critically on the elasticities of supply and demand:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Inelastic Demand</strong>: Consumers bear more of the tax burden.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Elastic Demand</strong>: Producers bear more of the tax burden.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="examples-of-inelastic-and-elastic-demand">Examples of Inelastic and Elastic Demand</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Inelastic demand results in consumers easily absorbing the tax burden (e.g. gas prices).</p></li>
        <li><p>Elastic demand allows producers to transfer the tax burden to the consumers less effectively, typically resulting in reduced prices or sales.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="income-tax-vs.-consumption-tax">Income Tax vs. Consumption Tax</h3>
        <p>The ongoing debate centers on whether to tax income or consumption:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Income Tax</strong>: Taxes savings and consumption simultaneously.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Consumption Tax</strong>: Encourages savings and does not penalize savings.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="impact-on-savings">Impact on Savings</h4>
        <p>Taxing consumption fosters savings, which leads to more capital for investment and economic growth.</p>
        <h3 id="transfers-and-implicit-taxes">Transfers and Implicit Taxes</h3>
        <p>Transfers may inadvertently create disincentives for work (substitution effects) because receiving transfer payments can reduce the impact of earned income: - <br /><span class="math display">Transfer = max (0, 10, 000 − Income)</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="categorical-transfers-and-in-kind-transfers">Categorical Transfers and In-Kind Transfers</h3>
        <p>Categorical transfers can mitigate inefficiencies:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>They target specific groups (e.g. families with disabled children).</p></li>
        <li><p>In-kind transfers (e.g. food stamps, housing) aid those in need without incentivizing avoidance of work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="earned-income-tax-credit-eitc">Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</h4>
        <p>The EITC represents a positive solution to the leaky bucket issue:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>It is a conditional cash transfer that incentivizes employment.</p></li>
        <li><p>A structure where government provides $0.40 for every dollar earned up to a limit, promoting labor force participation.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h5 id="effects-of-eitc-on-labor-supply">Effects of EITC on Labor Supply</h5>
        <ul>
        <li><p>At lower incomes, the EITC boosts labor supply by increasing income.</p></li>
        <li><p>Results in a more significant participation in the labor force without disincentivizing ongoing work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-18">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In summary, the lecture highlights the importance of understanding taxation structure, tax incidence, and the distinction between income and consumption taxation. Furthermore, programs like the EITC not only provide financial assistance but also stimulate economic activity, countering the challenges of redistributing wealth efficiently.</p>

        <h1 id="notes-on-social-insurance-and-market-failures">Notes on Social Insurance and Market Failures</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-to-social-insurance">Introduction to Social Insurance</h3>
        <p>Social insurance refers to government-provided insurance programs that mitigate risks associated with uncertainties in life. It represents the largest category of government expenditure in the United States.</p>
        <h4 id="importance-of-insurance">Importance of Insurance</h4>
        <p>Insurance is essential due to people’s aversion to risk and uncertainty. The private insurance market in the US, including health, auto, life, property, and casualty insurance, totals approximately $1.5 trillion annually.</p>
        <h3 id="market-failures-and-social-insurance">Market Failures and Social Insurance</h3>
        <p>While private insurance exists, there are circumstances leading to market failures that necessitate government involvement. One key reason is <strong>information asymmetry</strong>, where different parties have varying levels of information.</p>
        <h4 id="information-asymmetry">Information Asymmetry</h4>
        <p>Information asymmetry can lead to market failures, particularly in insurance markets.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Definition: Information asymmetry occurs when one party in a transaction possesses more or better information than the other party.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="the-lemons-problem">The Lemons Problem</h4>
        <p>George Akerlof’s (1970) "lemons problem" illustrates how information asymmetry can prevent a market from functioning optimally.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Example: In a 1970s used car market, sellers have information about the quality of the car, while buyers do not.</p></li>
        <li><p>Buyers will only pay an average price, fearing that they could buy a "lemon," or a poor-quality car.</p></li>
        <li><p>As a result, sellers of high-quality cars may exit the market, leading to a market collapse.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="insurance-context-and-adverse-selection">Insurance Context and Adverse Selection</h3>
        <p>In the insurance context, the information asymmetry is flipped.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The buyer (insured) knows their health risk better than the insurer (insurance company).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="adverse-selection">Adverse Selection</h4>
        <p>Adverse selection occurs when those most likely to need insurance (i.e., higher risks) are the ones who seek it out, while healthier individuals opt out. This leads to insurers facing higher-than-expected costs.</p>
        <h4 id="example-of-adverse-selection">Example of Adverse Selection</h4>
        <p>Let Ch represent expected costs for healthy individuals and Cs for sick individuals: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
            C_h &amp;= 0.1 \times 10,000 + 0.9 \times 0 = 1,000 \\
            C_s &amp;= 0.5 \times 10,000 + 0.5 \times 0 = 5,000\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
        <p>Expected costs for an insurer that doesn’t differentiate between healthy and sick individuals can lead to losses and an eventual market failure.</p>
        <h3 id="government-interventions">Government Interventions</h3>
        <p>Various solutions exist to mitigate adverse selection in insurance markets, including:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Subsidization: Providing tax credits to encourage healthy individuals to buy insurance.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mandates: Laws requiring everyone to buy health insurance (as seen with the Affordable Care Act).</p></li>
        <li><p>Direct Government Provision: Programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="trade-offs-of-solutions">Trade-offs of Solutions</h4>
        <p>Each solution comes with limitations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Subsidization</strong> can be costly but encourages participation.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Mandates</strong> can create dissatisfaction among healthier populations.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Direct provision</strong> is less popular due to its high cost to taxpayers.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="moral-hazard-and-its-consequences">Moral Hazard and Its Consequences</h3>
        <p>Moral hazard refers to the idea that individuals may undertake riskier behavior when they are insured.</p>
        <h4 id="consequences-of-moral-hazard">Consequences of Moral Hazard</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Lower Efficiency: With insurance, individuals may reduce their efforts to avoid risks, leading to inefficiencies.</p></li>

        <h3 id="illustrative-examples">Illustrative Examples</h3>
        <h4 id="social-security">Social Security</h4>
        <p>The Social Security program offers an example of a social insurance program designed to provide income after retirement, funded by a 12.4% payroll tax.</p>
        <h4 id="trade-off-evaluation">Trade-off Evaluation</h4>
        <ul>
        <li><p>The U.S. incentivizes delayed retirement with higher monthly benefits (<em>6.7% increase per year delayed</em>).</p></li>
        <li><p>In other countries, like the Netherlands, there are less favorable terms for working, leading to lower labor participation rates.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion-20">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The government plays a crucial role in insurance markets due to the information asymmetries and adverse selection risks that plague private insurance. However, the challenge lies in designing systems that balance coverage while mitigating moral hazard effects.</p>
        <h1 id="notes-on-externalities-2">Notes on Externalities</h1>
        <h3 id="introduction-12">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Externalities are key to understanding market failures. The first fundamental theorem of economics states that competitive markets maximize total social welfare. However, this can be hindered by several barriers, one of which is externalities.</p>
        <h4 id="definition-of-externality">Definition of Externality</h4>
        <p>An <strong>externality</strong> occurs when one party’s actions affect the well-being of another party without that party’s consent. Mathematically, we can express this as: <br /><span class="math display">Externality = Impact on Party A ≠ Costs/Beneﬁts borne by Party A</span><br /></p>
        <h3 id="types-of-externalities">Types of Externalities</h3>
        <p>Externalities can be categorized into negative and positive externalities, and can occur in both production and consumption contexts.</p>
        <h4 id="negative-production-externality">Negative Production Externality</h4>
        <p>A classic example involves a steel plant that produces sludge as a byproduct. This sludge harms fishermen downstream who rely on clean water for their livelihood.</p>
        <p>Let <span class="math inline"><em>Q</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span> be the quantity of steel produced, and the relationship is: <br /><span class="math display">Sludge produced ∝ <em>Q</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span><br /> The external cost to fishermen occurs because the steel plant does not account for the economic damage caused.</p>
        <h5 id="welfare-implications-1">Welfare Implications</h5>
        <p>The market produces steel at the intersection of the private marginal cost (PMC) and the private marginal benefit (PMB). However, socially optimal production occurs when the social marginal cost (SMC) equals the social marginal benefit (SMB).</p>
        <p><br /><span class="math display">Social Marginal Cost = Private Marginal Cost + Marginal Damage</span><br /></p>
        <p>The optimal outcome at this point leads to overproduction, resulting in a deadweight loss, represented graphically as: - The deadweight loss triangle can be illustrated between points A, B, and C, where marginal social cost exceeds marginal social benefit.</p>
        <h3 id="negative-consumption-externalities-1">Negative Consumption Externalities</h3>
        <p>Negative consumption externalities occur when an individual’s consumption reduces the utility of another individual without compensation.</p>
        <h4 id="example-smoking-1">Example: Smoking</h4>
        <p>When an individual smokes, they may affect others through secondhand smoke or increased healthcare costs.</p>
        <h3 id="positive-externalities">Positive Externalities</h3>
        <p>Externalities can also be positive, whereby the actions of one party benefit others.</p>
        <h4 id="example-research-and-development-rd">Example: Research and Development (R&amp;D)</h4>
        <p>Investments in R&amp;D not only benefit the firm but also create societal benefits due to knowledge spillovers. The social benefit is often higher than the private benefit.</p>
        <p>For firms: <br /><span class="math display">Social Marginal Benefit &gt; Private Marginal Benefit</span><br /></p>
        <p>Firms tend to underinvest in R&amp;D due to these spillover benefits.</p>
        <h3 id="government-intervention-2">Government Intervention</h3>
        <p>To address externalities, governments can implement:</p>
        <h4 id="corrective-taxes-1">Corrective Taxes</h4>
        <p>A corrective tax can internalize negative externalities by aligning private costs with social costs.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>For example: A tax equal to the marginal damage from pollution helps align the firm’s private marginal cost with society’s social marginal cost.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="subsidies">Subsidies</h4>
        <p>For positive externalities, governments can incentivize behavior that creates external benefits through subsidies.</p>
        <h4 id="regulation">Regulation</h4>
        <p>Another approach is regulatory mandates that directly control the level of goods produced or consumed, like production quotas on pollution.</p>
        <h3 id="real-world-applications-1">Real-World Applications</h3>
        <h4 id="environmental-externalities">Environmental Externalities</h4>
        <p>Addressing climate change is crucial. Current models suggest implementing a carbon tax that accurately reflects the marginal cost of carbon emissions to combat climate change.</p>
        <h4 id="health-externalities-1">Health Externalities</h4>
        <p>Smoking induces significant health costs on society, and measures like information campaigns, taxation on cigarettes, and illegalization of certain products could be emphasized to mitigate these externalities.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion-21">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Understanding externalities is critical for assessing the efficiency and equity of market outcomes and formulating effective government policies for intervention.</p>
