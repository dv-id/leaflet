      <h1 id="accounting">Accounting 101</h1>
      <h1 id="overview-of-accounting">Overview of Accounting</h1>
      <p>Accounting serves a crucial role in business through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Checking transactions to ensure accuracy</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Consistent recording of these transactions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reporting that allows understanding of financial health</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Contrary to some beliefs, the role of accountants is not to forecast the future or to value businesses or
        assets;
        rather, they are considered historians, recording past transactions.</p>
      <h3 id="key-questions-addressed-by-accounting">Key Questions Addressed by Accounting</h3>
      <p>The three fundamental questions any stakeholder should be able to answer from accounting statements are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>What do you own?</strong> (Assets)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>What do you owe?</strong> (Liabilities)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>How much money did you make?</strong> (Earnings/Cash Flow)</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>These questions can be addressed through three primary financial statements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Balance Sheet</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Income Statement</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Statement of Cash Flows</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="financial-statements">Financial Statements</h3>
      <h4 id="balance-sheet">Balance Sheet</h4>
      <p>The Balance Sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time and
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Assets:</strong> What the company owns</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><em>Fixed Assets:</em> Long-term physical assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Current Assets:</em> Short-term assets (e.g., cash, inventory, accounts receivable)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Financial Assets:</em> Investments in other companies (stocks/bonds)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Intangible Assets:</em> Non-physical assets (e.g., patents, brand names)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Liabilities:</strong> What the company owes</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><em>Current Liabilities:</em> Debts due within one year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Long-term Liabilities:</em> Debts due after one year (e.g., bank loans, bonds)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><em>Other Liabilities:</em> Obligations (e.g., pension funds, healthcare obligations)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Equity:</strong> The residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The basic equation governing the balance sheet can be represented as: <br /><span
          class="math display">Assets = Liabilities + Equity</span><br /></p>
      <h4 id="income-statement">Income Statement</h4>
      <p>The Income Statement details the company’s financial performance over a specific period, focusing on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Revenues:</strong> Total income from sales</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> Direct costs attributable to production</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Calculated as: <br /><span class="math display">Gross
              Profit = Revenues − COGS</span><br /></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Operating Expenses:</strong> Indirect costs (e.g., marketing, administrative)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Operating Profit:</strong> Calculated as: <br /><span class="math display">Operating Profit = Gross
              Profit − Operating Expenses</span><br /></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Net Income:</strong> Final profit after taxes and other non-operating expenses</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="statement-of-cash-flows">Statement of Cash Flows</h4>
      <p>The Statement of Cash Flows explains the changes in cash balances due to operational, investing, and financing
        activities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Operations:</strong> Driven by net income, adjustments for non-cash expenses, and
            changes in working capital</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Investing:</strong> Cash spent on capital expenditures or investments in other
            businesses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Financing:</strong> Cash received from issuing debt/equity and cash paid for
            dividends or debt repayments</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The fundamental equation for change in cash balance can be simplified as: <br /><span
          class="math display"><em>Δ</em>Cash = Cash Flows from Operations + Cash Flows from Investing + Cash Flows from
          Financing</span><br /></p>
      <h3 id="interconnections-of-financial-statements">Interconnections of Financial Statements</h3>
      <p>The three financial statements are interconnected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization from the income statement are added back in the cash flow statement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Investments in fixed assets on the balance sheet reflect as capital expenditures in the cash flow
            statement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changes in the balance sheet components influence cash flow movements.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="accounting-standards">Accounting Standards</h3>
      <p>Accounting practices are governed by formalized rules to ensure consistency and comparability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>GAAP:</strong> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles used predominantly in the United States.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>IFRS:</strong> International Financial Reporting Standards used in many other countries.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding and applying these standards is crucial for accurate financial analysis.</p>
      <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>As students of accounting, it is essential to interpret financial statements with an accounting mindset.
        Approach
        each statement analytically and remember that the evolving nature of accounting practices affects reporting and
        analysis.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>In this session, we will cover the fundamental concepts of income statements, focusing on the differences
        between
        cash accounting and accrual accounting.</p>
      <h3 id="accounting-methods">Accounting Methods</h3>
      <h4 id="cash-accounting">Cash Accounting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Revenue is recorded when cash is received.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Expenses are recorded when cash is paid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Suitable for very small businesses (often called checkbook accounting).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="accrual-accounting">Accrual Accounting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Revenue is recorded when it is earned, regardless of when cash is received.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Expenses are recorded when they are incurred, not necessarily when they are paid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This method follows the principle of recognizing transactions when they occur.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Example: Selling an item on December 30 does require recognizing revenue in the financials for that year,
            even without payment.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="classification-of-expenses">Classification of Expenses</h3>
      <p>Expenses can be broadly categorized into three types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Operating Expenses (OPEX)</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Expenses tied directly to revenue generation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Examples: Labor, materials.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Financing Expenses (FINEX)</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Costs related to capital not derived from equity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Examples: Interest on loans or debt.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Capital Expenses (CAPEX)</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Long-term investments that provide benefits over years.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Examples: Buildings, machinery.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="income-statement-structure">Income Statement Structure</h3>
      <p>The typical income statement follows this structure: <br /><span class="math display">Net
          Income = Revenue − Cost
          of Goods Sold (COGS) − Operating Expenses − Financing Expenses − Taxes</span><br /></p>
      <h4 id="income-statement-breakdown">Income Statement Breakdown</h4>
      <p><strong>1. Revenues:</strong> Total sales minus returns and discounts. <strong>2. Cost of Goods Sold
          (COGS):</strong> Direct costs associated with producing the products/services. <strong>3. Gross
          Profit:</strong>
        <br /><span class="math display">Gross Profit = Revenue − COGS</span><br /> <strong>4. Operating
          Profit:</strong>
        <br /><span class="math display">Operating Profit = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses</span><br /> <strong>5.
          Taxable Income:</strong> <br /><span class="math display">Taxable Income = Operating Profit − Financing

      <h4 id="revenue-recognition-challenges">Revenue Recognition Challenges</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Long-term Contracts :</strong> Revenue from contracts spanning multiple years is often recognized
            proportionately to the service provided.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> A three-year software contract requires splitting revenue over the contract
            duration.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Geographical Breakdown :</strong> Companies need to report revenue sources by geographical
            location.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Segment Reporting :</strong> Companies may need to separate revenue based on different business
            segments.</p>
        </li>

          <p><strong>Other Operating Expenses</strong>: Include selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&amp;A),
            which cannot be directly traced to specific products.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="depreciation">Depreciation</h4>
      <p>Depreciation is a way to allocate capital expenses over time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Economic Depreciation</strong>: Reflects actual loss of asset value over time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Accounting Depreciation</strong>: - <em>Straight-Line Depreciation</em>: <br /><span

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Tax Depreciation</strong>: Focuses on minimizing taxable income rather than reflecting true asset
            value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="financing-expenses">Financing Expenses</h3>
      <ul>

      <h3 id="extraordinary-items">Extraordinary Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Defined as non-recurring income or expenses that should be separated from typical income to avoid skewing
            financial results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Caution is advised if extraordinary items appear regularly, as they may not be truly extraordinary.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3 id="pro-forma-statements">Pro Forma Statements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Companies may provide pro forma income statements, which adjust accounting expenses for more favorable
            interpretations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Important for investors to scrutinize these adjustments for validity.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The final goal of an income statement is to provide a clear picture of a company’s earnings through various
        classifications of income and expenses, adhering to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
        Understanding
        these classifications and their impact on reported net income is crucial for informed financial analysis.</p>

          <p><strong>Commodity Companies</strong>: E.g., Total (French oil company)</p>

      <h3 id="conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Understanding income statements requires consideration of the lifecycle stage of a company and the sector in

        performance necessitates adjusting for these variations as companies evolve.</p>
      <h1 id="balance-sheet-1">Balance Sheet</h1>
      <h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>
      <p>In this session, we explore the concept of balance sheets in accounting, outlining two primary perspectives on
        their purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Record of capital invested in assets (historical cost)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Reflection of current market value or liquidation value of assets</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These dual perspectives illustrate the complexity and the potential discrepancies in balance sheet accounting.
      </p>
      <h3 id="types-of-assets">Types of Assets</h3>
      <p>The balance sheet categorizes assets into several types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Fixed Assets:</strong> Physical assets with long lives.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Current Assets:</strong> Assets with a life of less than one year.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Financial Assets:</strong> Investments in securities or other companies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Non-physical assets like brand names.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 id="fixed-and-current-assets">Fixed and Current Assets</h4>
      <p><strong>Old Method vs. Fair Value Accounting</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Old Method: Record fixed assets at the purchase price less accumulated depreciation. <br /><span
              class="math display">Net Book Value = Purchase Price − Accumulated Depreciation</span><br /></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fair Value Accounting: Record fixed assets based on their current market value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="financial-assets">Financial Assets</h4>
      <p>The accounting treatment depends on the type of securities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Publicly Traded Securities:</strong> Reflect market value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Holdings in Other Companies:</strong> - Minority stakes: Use the equity method, report
            proportionate
            income/loss. - Majority stakes: Consolidate financial statements with 100% revenue/reporting.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="intangible-assets">Intangible Assets</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Significant intangible assets include brand equity and technological advantages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Goodwill:</strong> The primary intangible asset recorded is goodwill, which arises from
            acquisitions
            and reflects the premium paid over the book value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Goodwill is problematic as it often does not reflect true underlying value and can lead to distortions.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Shareholders’ Equity:</strong> May shrink if the company returns substantial cash to shareholders.

      <h1 id="statement-of-cash-flows-1">Statement of Cash Flows</h1>
      <h3 id="introduction-4">Introduction</h3>
      <p>Having discussed Income Statements and Balance Sheets, we now turn to the third essential financial statement:
        the Statement of Cash Flows (SCF). The SCF provides critical insight into how cash flows are generated and used
        in
        a company.</p>
      <h3 id="objectives-of-the-statement-of-cash-flows">Objectives of the Statement of Cash Flows</h3>
      <p>The primary objectives of the SCF are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>To explain how much the cash balance of a company changed during a certain period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To provide insights into:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Cash flows from operations</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Cash flows from investing</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Cash flows from financing</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="structure-of-the-statement-of-cash-flows">Structure of the Statement of Cash Flows</h3>
      <p>The SCF is typically divided into three sections:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Operations (CFO)</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Investing (CFI)</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows from Financing (CFF)</strong></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="cash-flows-from-operations">Cash Flows from Operations</h3>
      <p>Cash flows from operations typically start with <strong>Net Income</strong>: <br /><span
          class="math display">CFO = Net Income + Non-Cash Charges − Change in Non-Cash Working Capital</span><br /></p>
      <h4 id="adjustments-to-net-income">Adjustments to Net Income</h4>
      <p>To convert Net Income into Cash Flows from Operations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Add back non-cash expenses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Depreciation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Amortization</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Subtract changes in non-cash working capital:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Increase in Accounts Receivable: Decrease in Cash Flow</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Increase in Inventory: Decrease in Cash Flow</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Increase in Accounts Payable: Increase in Cash Flow</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="non-cash-working-capital">Non-Cash Working Capital</h4>
      <p><strong>Non-Cash Working Capital</strong> is the difference between current assets and liabilities, excluding
        cash and cash equivalents. It affects cash flow as follows: <br /><span class="math display">Change in Non-Cash
          Working Capital = <em>Δ</em>Accounts Receivable + <em>Δ</em>Inventory − <em>Δ</em>Accounts
          Payable</span><br />
      </p>
      <h3 id="cash-flows-from-investing">Cash Flows from Investing</h3>
      <p>Cash flows from investing reflect the investments made by the company. This section can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Cash spent on capital expenditures (CAPEX): <br /><span class="math display">Net Investment in Operating
              Assets = CAPEX − Cash Proceeds from Sale of Assets</span><br /></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cash spent on non-operating investments (e.g., marketable securities, other companies).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="cash-flows-from-financing">Cash Flows from Financing</h3>
      <p>Cash flows from financing arise from activities that fund the business. This section is broken down into:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows to/from Debt</strong>: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
              \text{Net Cash Flow from Debt} &amp;= \text{Cash Inflow from New Debt} - \text{Cash Outflow from Debt
              Repayment}
              \end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cash Flows to/from Equity</strong>: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
              \text{Net Cash Flow from Equity} &amp;= \text{Cash Inflow from Issuance} - (\text{Cash Outflow for
              Dividends
              + Cash Outflow for Buybacks})
              \end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="key-comparisons-in-cash-flows">Key Comparisons in Cash Flows</h3>
      <p>When analyzing cash flows, compare the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Depreciation (CFO)</strong> vs. <strong>Capital Expenditures (CFI)</strong>: Companies with growth
            should show CAPEX greater than depreciation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Keep in mind that certain acquisitions may not reflect in cash flows if paid with equity, limiting the
            visibility of cash transactions.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="potential-dividends-from-cash-flows">Potential Dividends from Cash Flows</h3>
      <p>The free cash flow available for dividends or stock buybacks can be calculated as follows: <br /><span
          class="math display">Free Cash Flow to Equity = CFO − Capital Expenditures + Cash Inflows − Debt
          Payments</span><br /></p>
      <h3 id="conclusion-3">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>The Statement of Cash Flows distinguishes itself by emphasizing cash movements rather than accrual accounting.
        It
        is essential for understanding the real cash position of a company and potential returns to investors.</p>
      <h1 id="understanding-statements-of-cash-flows">Understanding Statements of Cash Flows</h1>
      <h3 id="introduction-5">Introduction</h3>
      <p>A statement of cash flows summarizes the cash generated and used during a specific period. It divides cash

        into three main sections: Operating, Investing, and Financing. Understanding these cash flows helps in analyzing
        the financial health and trajectory of a company.</p>
      <h3 id="lifecycle-perspective-of-companies">Lifecycle Perspective of Companies</h3>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The three tax rates may diverge due to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>International operations with different marginal tax rates.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Legal tax deferral and avoidance strategies.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="deferred-taxes">Deferred Taxes</h4>
      <p>Deferred taxes arise when there’s a difference between what a company reports and what it actually pays:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Deferred Tax Assets</strong> (if paid more in taxes): expected reduction in future tax payments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Deferred Tax Liabilities</strong> (if paid less in taxes): expected increase in future tax
            payments.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Net Operating Loss (NOL) can be carried forward (up to 20 years) or backward (up to 2 years) affecting future
        tax
        strategies.</p>
      <h3 id="stock-based-compensation">Stock-Based Compensation</h3>
      <p>Stock-based compensation links management and employee interests with shareholders. It includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Stock Options: the right to buy shares at a fixed price.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Restricted Stock: shares given but not tradable.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="expense-treatment">Expense Treatment</h4>
      <p>Post-2004, companies must value options at grant date: <br /><span class="math display">Operating
          Expense = Value
          of Options Granted</span><br /> Companies should not add back stock-based compensation when calculating cash
        flows, as it represents a genuine dilution of shares.</p>
      <h3 id="lease-commitments-as-debt">Lease Commitments as Debt</h3>
      <p>Leases, especially long-term ones, should be viewed as debt. The distinction between capital leases (treated as
        debt) and operating leases (treated as expenses) was eliminated in 2019.</p>
      <h4 id="conversion-process">Conversion Process</h4>
      <p>To convert lease commitments to debt:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Calculate the present value of future lease payments using the pre-tax cost of borrowing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Record the present value as lease liability on the balance sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Create a corresponding intangible asset category for the lease asset.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Operating income must be adjusted by removing lease expenses and adding depreciation.</p>
      <h3 id="research-and-development-rd-as-capital-expenditure">Research and Development (R&amp;D) as Capital
        Expenditure</h3>
      <p>R&amp;D expenditures create long-term benefits and should be capitalized:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Determine amortization life for R&amp;D costs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Collect R&amp;D expenses from prior years.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Adjust earnings by adding back R&amp;D and deducting amortization.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This logic can extend to other contractual commitments like advertising, training, and customer acquisition
        costs.</p>
      <h3 id="conclusion-5">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Traditional accounting frameworks are based on outdated economic conditions. Analysts must adapt financial
        statements for relevance in today’s economy, ensuring accurate representation of a firm’s financial health.</p>
      <h1 id="accounting-inconsistencies">Accounting Inconsistencies</h1>
      <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
      <p>This document presents detailed notes on key accounting inconsistencies, specifically focusing on tax rates,
        non-debt commitments, capital expenditures, and stockholder-based compensation. Each section discusses the
        implications of these inconsistencies on financial statements.</p>
      <h3 id="tax-rates">Tax Rates</h3>
      <h4 id="effective-tax-rate-calculation">Effective Tax Rate Calculation</h4>
      <p>Given a set of companies, the effective tax rate can be calculated using:</p>
      <p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{\text{Taxes Paid}}{\text{Taxable
          Income}}$$</span><br /></p>
      <h4 id="observations">Observations</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Companies like <strong>Peloton</strong> (0%) and <strong>Netflix</strong> (9.5%) exhibit low or zero
            effective tax rates, typically seen in younger companies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Coca-Cola</strong> pays 16.8%, while <strong>HSBC</strong> pays nearly 35%.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Notably, <strong>Dr. Reddy’s Labs</strong> reported a negative tax rate due to a tax credit resulting in a
            recovery of $1.6 billion.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="cash-flow-analysis">Cash Flow Analysis</h4>
      <p>To understand taxes paid in cash flow terms, reference the cash flow statement alongside the income statement.
        The actual taxes paid can differ significantly due to deferred taxes:</p>
      <p><br /><span class="math display">Total Cash Taxes Paid = Taxes from Income Statement + Deferred
          Taxes</span><br /></p>
      <h3 id="non-debt-commitments">Non-Debt Commitments</h3>
      <h4 id="understanding-commitments">Understanding Commitments</h4>
      <p>Even if contractual obligations (e.g., leases) are not labeled as debt, they represent future cash outflows
        that
        need to be accounted for.</p>
      <h4 id="lease-commitments">Lease Commitments</h4>
      <p>Historically, lease obligations were treated as operating expenses. However, as of 2019, they are recognized as
        debt on balance sheets.</p>
      <p>For instance, <strong>Nordstrom’s</strong> lease commitments in its financial statements were converted into a
        present value debt figure:</p>
      <h4 id="present-value-calculation">Present Value Calculation</h4>
      <p>Assuming an interest rate of 4.7% for discounting future lease payments, the present value (PV) of commitments
        can be calculated by:</p>
      <p><br /><span class="math display">$$PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Lease Payment}_t}{(1+r)^t}$$</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>This change increases the total debt and total assets on the balance sheet, while operating income will be
        influenced by depreciation of these lease assets.</p>
      <h3 id="capital-expenditures">Capital Expenditures</h3>
      <h4 id="distinction-between-tangible-and-intangible-assets">Distinction Between Tangible and Intangible Assets
      </h4>
      <p>Capital expenditures (CapEx) can include both physical (tangible) and non-physical (intangible) investments.
        Key
        observations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Research and Development (R&amp;D) spending is typically treated as an operating expense rather than CapEx.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This accounting treatment results in significant underrepresentation of company assets and overstatement of
            operating expenses.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="amortizing-rd-expenses">Amortizing R&amp;D Expenses</h4>
      <p>To transform R&amp;D expenses from operating to capital expenses, follow this process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Estimate the amortizable life of R&amp;D (e.g., 10 years for pharmaceuticals).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Calculate the cumulative R&amp;D expenses historically.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Calculate annual depreciation based on the estimated amortization.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>For example, if \$3.03 billion is reported as R&amp;D expense, and $1.69 billion would be recognized as
        amortization, then:</p>
      <p><br /><span class="math display">Effective Income = Reported Income + R&amp;D
          Expense − Amortization</span><br />
      </p>
      <h3 id="stock-based-compensation-1">Stock-Based Compensation</h3>
      <h4 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h4>
      <p>Prior to 2004, stock options were often treated as zero value, leading to inconsistencies in reported earnings.
        Post-2004 standards require the valuation of stock options at issuance.</p>
      <h4 id="impact-on-financial-statements">Impact on Financial Statements</h4>
      <p>Consider a company like <strong>Netflix</strong> that reports stock-based compensation. The financial
        implications include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Stock-based compensation is now an expense, affecting net income.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Accumulative options can dilute earnings per share (EPS).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Quantifying the impact on cash flows can be misleading since stock options result in actual share dilution
        rather
        than merely representing non-cash expenses.</p>
      <h3 id="conclusion-6">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In accounting, understanding these inconsistencies helps refine financial analysis. By approaching financial
        statements with this framework, investors can better assess company performance and value beyond conventional
        accounting practices.</p>

      <h3 id="accounting-returns-2">Accounting Returns</h3>
      <p>Accounting returns were analyzed using Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
        <br /><span class="math display">$$ROE = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Book Equity}}$$</span><br /> <br /><span
          class="math display">$$ROIC = \frac{\text{After-Tax Operating Income}}{\text{Invested Capital}} =
          \frac{\text{Operating Income} \times (1 - \text{Effective Tax Rate})}{\text{Book Equity} + \text{Debt} -
          \text{Cash}}$$</span><br /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Notable findings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Dr. Reddy’s has minimal debt, thus showing high ROE.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Peloton’s ROE is notably negative due to losses.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="efficiency-ratios-1">Efficiency Ratios</h3>
      <p>Efficiency ratios were computed using: <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Sales to Invested Capital} =
          \frac{\text{Revenues}}{\text{Invested Capital}}$$</span><br /> <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Asset

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Netflix : Most efficient with a revenue generation of $1.71 for every dollar of invested capital.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Growth Considerations : As Netflix scaled, efficiency improved, indicating operational leverage benefits as
            companies mature.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="debt-ratios-1">Debt Ratios</h3>
      <p>Debt ratios such as Debt to Equity and Debt to Capital ratios were analyzed: <br /><span
          class="math display">$$\text{Debt to Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Book Equity}} \quad
          \text{or} \quad \frac{\text{Market Debt}}{\text{Market Equity}}$$</span><br /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Notable observations on debt:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Netflix has a high Book Debt to Equity Ratio (195%), but a significantly lower Market Debt to Equity
                Ratio (7%).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Dr. Reddy’s demonstrates minimal debt across all measures.</p>

          Expense}}$$</span><br /> <br /><span class="math display">$$\text{Fixed Charge Coverage} =
          \frac{\text{Operating
          Income} + \text{Fixed Charges}}{\text{Fixed Charges} + \text{Interest}}$$</span><br /></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Dr. Reddy’s : High ratios indicating low risk.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Current Ratios and Quick Ratios : Given less utility in recent times, they may not accurately reflect a
            company’s short-term health.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="conclusion-8">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Financial ratios are valuable tools but should be approached with caution. Key recommendations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Use a select few ratios that best represent the business’s performance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure ratios support your understanding of a company’s operational effectiveness and future potential.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Conduct an average-based analysis (normalization) for volatile companies to mitigate year-to-year
            fluctuations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Remember, ratios are tools for analysis—not ends in themselves.</p>
