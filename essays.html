                            <p> Cooperation emerges when there is a high likelihood of repeated interactions between the players in the future – we will call it δ – and it yields some benefits later on – reciprocity. If you interact with the same player in the future you can reason that if you defect him in the first interaction he won’t cooperate with you in the next round. What if you need somebody to cooperate with? For example you won't be able to hunt down a large animal by yourself, you would only hunt small animals. That's the only thing you can pull off on your own. But imagine that you have to survive a cold winter and the only way to do it is to hunt large animals for their fur to stay warm when it’s freezing. You can’t do it only by yourself. You need to cooperate with others to hunt the animal down. Everyone would be better off if they got themselves to cooperate. Without cooperation they would not survive winter.</p>
                            <p> We can spot cooperation everywhere around us in our everyday lives. Business partners are nice to each other because they are helping each other make money and expect to do so in the future. People behave nicely in their neighborhoods because the interactions between neighbors are likely to be long-term and you don’t want to make enemies in a place you won’t leave for a while (Whenever a new family moves to a new neighborhood in an american movie, they usually go around with gifts to their neighbors to make a good first impression). The existence of money relies on cooperation. What if you could not exchange money for goods and services in the future? You would not exchange anything for money in the first place. It would be worthless. </p>
                            <p> We are going to go through two case studies on vampire bats by Gerald S. Wilkinson and on soldiers during World War I by Robert Axelrod to conclude that our two main principles: high δ and reciprocity are at the core of interactions between players in these case studies. “Once the US and the USSR know that they will be dealing with each other indefinitely, the necessary preconditions for cooperation will exist.... The foundation of cooperation is not really trust, but the durability of the relationship." — Robert Axelrod </p>
                            <p> In an utopian world we could replace the US and USSR with every other state on Earth to embrace all potential gain from the cooperation of nations and live peacefully forever after, since we all share the same planet together and likely will be in the future. First of all we are going to use the famous Prisoners dilemma model to see how two players make strategic decisions in a one-shot interaction. The players choose whether to cooperate or defect. Cooperation is costly, but it benefits the other player by more than it costs – c < b. Thus it would be better if both of them cooperate, but there is a catch. When they are deciding what strategy to choose, they are always better off defecting. Regardless of what the other does, it pays off more to defect. This is called a dominant strategy in Game theory jargon. So looking at the interaction from an individual's point of view they both defect, but that's worse than the outcome that could be accomplished by cooperation. Yet people cooperate all the time. They help each other, they care for each other. Why is that? The answer lies in repeated interactions. There’s no reason to cooperate when you interact just once with the other player and never see them again. But people don't really interact exactly once with each other. There are situations all around us where you have to deal with the same people over and over again. How does that change the interactions? </p>
                            <p> To find out, let's try to see how the repeated prisoners' dilemma works. In each interaction, both players play the same prisoner’s dilemma – they choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D). Then they learn what the other did and play another round. Every additional round will happen with a probability δ (or you can think about it as a discounting factor that values future rounds less than the current round). If the interactions are likely to be repeated the δ is closer to 1. Imagine that the interaction happens between two business people. If the benefits of cooperation exceed the costs – b> c – and the δ is high – close to one – then they will both benefit from cooperation. What if someone decides to deviate from cooperation and suddenly defect the other player. He would be incentivized to do that because he could gain without paying the cost. What should the betrayed do in the next round?</p>
                            <p> We can come up with many different strategies for the repeated prisoner's dilemma. Players can cooperate in every round no matter what happened in previous interactions – ALLC strategy. Or they can defect everytime – ALLD. They can even make some conditions in their strategies like: cooperate in the first round and then from that point forward, simply copy what the other did in the previous round – Tit-for-tat (TFT). Cooperate in the first round, then continue to cooperate as long as neither of you has defected, if anyone defected you always defect from that point on – Grim trigger. And so on. Robert Axelrod organized a tournament of different strategies submitted by experts. Each of the strategies were paired off against each other to see, which would do best. The winner of all complex strategies was a simple Tit-for-tat strategy – reciprocity strategy. A second round was also won by the same strategy. From all of the interactions he concluded some principles for a successful strategy. Those were: Avoidance of unnecessary conflict by cooperating as long as the other player does. Provocability in the face of an uncalled-for defection by the other. Forgiveness after responding to a provocation and clarity of behavior so that the other player can recognize and adapt to your pattern of action. </p>
                            <p> So far we have come to a few main principles that have to be present in order for cooperation to emerge – cooperation has to benefit more than it costs, δ has to be high, reciprocity has to be present. Let’s see if we can spot these principles in action in two case studies – one regarding the fighting in trenches during the World War I by Robert Axelrod and the other on food sharing in Vampire bats by Gerald S. Wilkinson. In the Evolution of Cooperation (title), Robert Axelrod provided an example which shows that cooperation can arise when δ is high even in the worst environment: the trenches of World War I. Because of the technology of the time, the best way to get over a trench was to go around it. Thus the opposing sides both dug trenches all the way from the North Atlantic in Belgium to the Alps in the south. This meant that the war was going to be fought in the trenches for a long time and that the same soldiers were going to face off against the same soldiers for a period of time – the δ was high. This opened the door for cooperation. Soldiers stopped fighting for real, they faked fighting by sniping and bombarding the same places over and over again to make it totally obvious for the enemies that they were not planning to hurt them and expecting to benefit from the same treatment. There are even records of soldiers apologizing for accidentally firing a round at a place and time that wasn’t expected. When soldiers shot unexpectedly or for real, the other side didn’t hold back and fired way harder back to show them that they should not do that again – punished them for breaking cooperation. This act of punishment seem to abide by the quote: “If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.” – Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince The cooperation ended when the commanders on both sides noticed and made sure that no unit of soldiers faced the enemies for a long period of time – thus making the δ low. </p>
                            <p> Let’s now find out if it's more likely for players to cooperate with those who have cooperated with them in the past – reciprocity. Gerald S. Wilkinson studied Vampire bats that are prone to starve if they hunt unsuccessfully for a few nights in a row, but they seem to be highly thankful to the other vampire bats that feed them in times of need. When bats return from a successful hunt, they will give some of the blood in its mouth to the bats that were unsuccessful. Wilkinson showed that a previously starving bat was eager to repay the favor to the bat that helped him when he needed it the most – high reciprocity. This study shows us that reciprocity is needed for cooperation to emerge. High δ was also present in this study – a lot of vampire bats had been in the same group for a long time. </p>
                            <p> We’ve seen our principles for cooperation embraced by humans and even by bats. What if in these interactions there was somebody who was gaining the benefits and not paying any cost? In order to sustain cooperation these so called free-riders have to be punished for reaping the benefits without paying the costs. Otherwise the cooperation would not be stable and they would benefit by deviating. The punishment for not cooperating makes it less worth it for them. If free-riders go unpunished, the cooperative individuals also tend to stop cooperating. What if, in a group, the free-riders get punished but it is costly for the punishers to punish. Why would they punish the free-riders in the first case, when they could rely on the others to do it for them and reap the benefits anyway? david nikel 3 political science For the group to sustain cooperation it has to punish the free-riders and also punish those who have not been punished even though they should have had. This second order punishment motivates the punishers to punish the free-riders. So for cooperation to be sustained another principle plays a significant role – punishment of the free-riders and punishment of those who didn't punish the free-rider but should have had. The δ still has to be high in order for the punishment to have an effect. If it is not, the punisher would punish the free-rider never to interact with him again and thus would not reap any benefits from this punishment which is costly to him. This principle of a second order punishment seems to be similar to Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon in a sense that you would rather punish the free-rider than to get punished by others for not doing so, even though your inaction may be unwitnessed by others. Just the possibility of the punishment motivates you to punish the free-rider. </p>
                            <p> In summary, to sustain cooperation there must be a high likelihood of repeated interaction, past behavior must be highly observable. The δ must be high. Cooperating today must yield some future benefit, like others being more likely to cooperate with you later – reciprocity. Cooperative behavior needs to be conditional – people can’t just cooperate without a reason, as they might with someone they care about unconditionally like a family member just to improve his or her wellbeing. The foundation of cooperation is not really trust, but the durability of the interaction. If the conditions are right, the players come to cooperation by trial-and-error, learning what strategy comes with the biggest payoff or through imitation of other players who are successful. Even evolution helps us by eliminating the unsuccessful strategies and leaving us with the successful ones. If the conditions for cooperation are right it will emerge no matter what. </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>In order to live life to its fullest potential I have to spend my time wisely. As I am limited by time, I believe I have to maximize doing the things that bring me joy and / or meaning and minimize the time spent on things that don’t. Even though I try to do that every day, I sometimes find myself in a position where I don’t spend my time as I would prefer. I want to transition from deciding on the go to a written down vision of my life in order to steer more clearly towards it and organize my thoughts.</li>
                                <li>Firstly, I have to find the activities that bring me flow. So far I have figured out that the most amount of flow I experience when doing sports. As a kid when I was playing football or other sports in school, later on skateboarding, while loud music was on, striving to learn a new trick. The intense focus and the rewarding joy after learning a new trick or just enjoying the flow brought me great satisfaction. Then as I got into reading I enjoyed flow while reading some books, but not all of them, only the interesting, well written and illuminating ones.</li>
                                <li>Secondly, I need to figure out what is meaningful for me or makes me feel that the time was spent well, not regretting doing the activity in hindsight. So far, these activities fit the category of some sort of personal growth or doing something for me in order to improve. It could be physical like a morning stretching routine, doing sports, healthy eating or efficiently relaxing and it could be more learning or creating something like reading a new book on a topic that interests me, watching videos that satisfy my curiosity or creating an amateur website that visually appeals to me.</li>
                                <li>These were the things that I consider are worth the time of their pursuit. Focusing more on the future I want to envision the life that I consider well lived from my point of view and list all the things that could help me achieve it. I think that a productive morning sets the pace for the rest of the day, so a morning routine that would energize me, wake my body up and improve my health would be of benefit. It could be a morning stretching routine while listening to a podcast of interest or relaxing music, followed by swimming / a run / a workout and a healthy breakfast. After the routine I would like to work on something that I find interesting and exciting as well as meaningful. Something that adds value to the society, improves lives of others or is just something that I enjoy doing and working on. It could be building a company, investing in companies, philanthropy or just a hobby. I am yet to find a professional route that I want to take, as of now I don’t specialize in anything. Investing caught my attention but I don’t know if that is the path most desired by me. I am willing to try it since I am learning about how businesses work that could be helpful when starting my own company, not sure if I could handle that either but as I have discovered I don’t like being bossed around and working for somebody so I may try going on my own out of necessity. So the information gathered from researching companies could be helpful. I was thinking about researching industrial companies and finding a niche there so I could apply the knowledge when starting out myself. Another professional option would be to invest in new ventures, which is meaningful for improving lives as well as an interesting career, or so I think. After coming back from my job I would like to read interesting books or socialize with friends and family. As well as do sports such as cycling, running, swimming, surfing, skiing.</li>
                                <li>Surrounding environment also influences my wellbeing. It is important for me to be woken up by natural light so a house with windows that let that morning sun in is necessary. As I am interested in aesthetically pleasing houses I would like to live in one in the future. The house should not be very large only to contain possible guests but still keep its coziness. I would prefer a modern concrete house with a view into the tree crowns or nature. In the best case with a swimming pool where I could do my morning swimming laps regardless of the weather and a wellness room with a steam and / or sauna. The house should be situated somewhere where the neighbourhood / neighbours are nice as well as close to hiking routes / cycling routes / running routes not so far from the city where other options of leisure are located.</li>
                                <li>From a family standpoint I would like a big family if I can support it. I would like to have a wife that is passionate about something and I could help her with that and see her grow. I would like her to be ambitious and sporty.</li>
                                <li>In conclusion, I want to focus on things that will let me squeeze out the most of life and I think the key to that is to think and reflect on things we do, why we do them and how we feel about them. My preferences may change through time but I felt the need to write this down even though it is not so insightful for others and I may edit it in the future.</li>

                                <li>The purpose of this writing is to list all the expectations on my stay in Australia in advance so I can reflect on it later on. Unfortunately I am writing this after spending nine days in Adelaide already. After the arrival I was not particularly excited about being in Australia but that was likely caused by the long flight feeling very tired.</li>
                                <li>My apriori perception of Australia was mostly influenced by all the modern houses I have watched on youtube surrounded by wild nature and beaches. It was a sense of calm, beauty and robustness that appealed to me. I was envisioning a life full of sports in nature, beautiful views and a close proximity to entertainment in the nearby cities. Nicely tailored to family / adult life. At the same time I have watched a lot of appealing videos on the lifestyle here by travelers and locals. Their daily life seemed to be full of healthy habits such as eating healthy, doing all kinds of sports and a rich social life. All the while surrounded by an environment full of fauna and flora and never sleeping sun. With all those benefits that seem to be present only in exotic places on vacations, Australia also has a strong economy with a lot of career opportunities, which appealed to me since I wanted to try to work in a financially developed country and its finance industry. All these lead to a decision on when deciding where my life would be most well lived and of highest quality out of all the options.</li>
                                <li>Venturing on my own would be a check on my independence. I took that uncertainty about how I would do on my own as a challenge since there is no better time to do that than now. I have watched a lot of college vlogs from abroad on youtube and thought to myself that I want to experience the proper student life as well since I have kind of missed it studying my bachelors degree at a lenient university that was not demanding as much. My main focus would be to delve deep into the world of finance figuring out the mechanics of the financial system and researching companies. With the knowledge from my course I could make better informed decisions with my own investments and grow my wealth over time. The insights like different business models, industry specifics, financial workings of a company could also help me with my own ventures.</li>
                                <li>University requirements and course completion will be my primary focus as well as following the financial markets. Regarding my own ventures I was thinking of finally starting some. Eventually I would like to start a platform called point on which anybody could hire professionals and services as well as an app on which you would be able to fund peoples dreams or material needs that could be used instead of gifts. I also thought of finding an industrial niche in which I would control a lot of the market share in a small total addressable market so I would not face as big of a competition. In the meantime though it would be better to start small. I would start with a simple e-shop selling t-shirts with a limited downside and capital requirements or with a knowledge sharing course marketed through socials. Focusing on these goals would require immense focus and a fight with the distractions which could be plentiful. Many people from Europe come to Australia to live a free life full of adventure and social gatherings which suits many people but also provides no material value creation from my point of view. This creates an ever-present optimization dilemma on how much time and effort to allocate to short-term & long-term goals, to focus on the current moment or to focus on building something that could be of benefit in the future for a price of short-term suffering. As of now, I think it is worth being long-term oriented as I find myself feeling frustrated at the end of the day whenever I have not done something for the future or somehow improved. But there is nothing bad if someone holds an opposing mindset of living the moment to the fullest without much planning ahead, it is just a different view on living. My primary sub-goal is to have a healthy lifestyle here that includes a routine such as stretching after waking up, healthy breakfast, active lifestyle doing sports and reading a lot.</li>
                                <li>So far I am under the impression that many of the students in my building are not so social as they are avoiding eye contact and conversations and after these interactions I feel more socially disconnected. On the other hand it limits me to the exposure of distraction from the goals that I want to be primarily focused on, my primary focus is not to make as many friends as possible nor is it to spend the most time partying or hanging out.</li>
                                <li>Hopefully I will reach the goals in the next two years and things will turn out for the better. Let the time work its magic.</li>
