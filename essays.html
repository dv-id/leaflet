                                <p> Cooperation emerges when there is a high likelihood of repeated interactions between
                                    the players in the future – we will call it δ – and it yields some benefits later on
                                    – reciprocity. If you interact with the same player in the future you can reason
                                    that if you defect him in the first interaction he won’t cooperate with you in the
                                    next round. What if you need somebody to cooperate with? For example you won't be
                                    able to hunt down a large animal by yourself, you would only hunt small animals.
                                    That's the only thing you can pull off on your own. But imagine that you have to
                                    survive a cold winter and the only way to do it is to hunt large animals for their
                                    fur to stay warm when it’s freezing. You can’t do it only by yourself. You need to
                                    cooperate with others to hunt the animal down. Everyone would be better off if they
                                    got themselves to cooperate. Without cooperation they would not survive winter.</p>
                                <p> We can spot cooperation everywhere around us in our everyday lives. Business
                                    partners are nice to each other because they are helping each other make money and
                                    expect to do so in the future. People behave nicely in their neighborhoods because
                                    the interactions between neighbors are likely to be long-term and you don’t want to
                                    make enemies in a place you won’t leave for a while (Whenever a new family moves to
                                    a new neighborhood in an american movie, they usually go around with gifts to their
                                    neighbors to make a good first impression). The existence of money relies on
                                    cooperation. What if you could not exchange money for goods and services in the
                                    future? You would not exchange anything for money in the first place. It would be
                                    worthless. </p>
                                <p> We are going to go through two case studies on vampire bats by Gerald S. Wilkinson
                                    and on soldiers during World War I by Robert Axelrod to conclude that our two main
                                    principles: high δ and reciprocity are at the core of interactions between players
                                    in these case studies. “Once the US and the USSR know that they will be dealing with
                                    each other indefinitely, the necessary preconditions for cooperation will exist....
                                    The foundation of cooperation is not really trust, but the durability of the
                                    relationship." — Robert Axelrod </p>
                                <p> In an utopian world we could replace the US and USSR with every other state on Earth
                                    to embrace all potential gain from the cooperation of nations and live peacefully
                                    forever after, since we all share the same planet together and likely will be in the
                                    future. First of all we are going to use the famous Prisoners dilemma model to see
                                    how two players make strategic decisions in a one-shot interaction. The players
                                    choose whether to cooperate or defect. Cooperation is costly, but it benefits the
                                    other player by more than it costs – c < b. Thus it would be better if both of them
                                        cooperate, but there is a catch. When they are deciding what strategy to choose,
                                        they are always better off defecting. Regardless of what the other does, it pays
                                        off more to defect. This is called a dominant strategy in Game theory jargon. So
                                        looking at the interaction from an individual's point of view they both defect,
                                        but that's worse than the outcome that could be accomplished by cooperation. Yet
                                        people cooperate all the time. They help each other, they care for each other.
                                        Why is that? The answer lies in repeated interactions. There’s no reason to
                                        cooperate when you interact just once with the other player and never see them
                                        again. But people don't really interact exactly once with each other. There are
                                        situations all around us where you have to deal with the same people over and
                                        over again. How does that change the interactions? </p>
                                        <p> To find out, let's try to see how the repeated prisoners' dilemma works. In
                                            each interaction, both players play the same prisoner’s dilemma – they
                                            choose to cooperate (C) or defect (D). Then they learn what the other did
                                            and play another round. Every additional round will happen with a
                                            probability δ (or you can think about it as a discounting factor that values
                                            future rounds less than the current round). If the interactions are likely
                                            to be repeated the δ is closer to 1. Imagine that the interaction happens
                                            between two business people. If the benefits of cooperation exceed the costs
                                            – b> c – and the δ is high – close to one – then they will both benefit from
                                            cooperation. What if someone decides to deviate from cooperation and
                                            suddenly defect the other player. He would be incentivized to do that
                                            because he could gain without paying the cost. What should the betrayed do
                                            in the next round?</p>
                                        <p> We can come up with many different strategies for the repeated prisoner's
                                            dilemma. Players can cooperate in every round no matter what happened in
                                            previous interactions – ALLC strategy. Or they can defect everytime – ALLD.
                                            They can even make some conditions in their strategies like: cooperate in
                                            the first round and then from that point forward, simply copy what the other
                                            did in the previous round – Tit-for-tat (TFT). Cooperate in the first round,
                                            then continue to cooperate as long as neither of you has defected, if anyone
                                            defected you always defect from that point on – Grim trigger. And so on.
                                            Robert Axelrod organized a tournament of different strategies submitted by
                                            experts. Each of the strategies were paired off against each other to see,
                                            which would do best. The winner of all complex strategies was a simple
                                            Tit-for-tat strategy – reciprocity strategy. A second round was also won by
                                            the same strategy. From all of the interactions he concluded some principles
                                            for a successful strategy. Those were: Avoidance of unnecessary conflict by
                                            cooperating as long as the other player does. Provocability in the face of
                                            an uncalled-for defection by the other. Forgiveness after responding to a
                                            provocation and clarity of behavior so that the other player can recognize
                                            and adapt to your pattern of action. </p>
                                        <p> So far we have come to a few main principles that have to be present in
                                            order for cooperation to emerge – cooperation has to benefit more than it
                                            costs, δ has to be high, reciprocity has to be present. Let’s see if we can
                                            spot these principles in action in two case studies – one regarding the
                                            fighting in trenches during the World War I by Robert Axelrod and the other
                                            on food sharing in Vampire bats by Gerald S. Wilkinson. In the Evolution of
                                            Cooperation (title), Robert Axelrod provided an example which shows that
                                            cooperation can arise when δ is high even in the worst environment: the
                                            trenches of World War I. Because of the technology of the time, the best way
                                            to get over a trench was to go around it. Thus the opposing sides both dug
                                            trenches all the way from the North Atlantic in Belgium to the Alps in the
                                            south. This meant that the war was going to be fought in the trenches for a
                                            long time and that the same soldiers were going to face off against the same
                                            soldiers for a period of time – the δ was high. This opened the door for
                                            cooperation. Soldiers stopped fighting for real, they faked fighting by
                                            sniping and bombarding the same places over and over again to make it
                                            totally obvious for the enemies that they were not planning to hurt them and
                                            expecting to benefit from the same treatment. There are even records of
                                            soldiers apologizing for accidentally firing a round at a place and time
                                            that wasn’t expected. When soldiers shot unexpectedly or for real, the other
                                            side didn’t hold back and fired way harder back to show them that they
                                            should not do that again – punished them for breaking cooperation. This act
                                            of punishment seem to abide by the quote: “If an injury has to be done to a
                                            man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.” – Niccolo
                                            Machiavelli, The Prince The cooperation ended when the commanders on both
                                            sides noticed and made sure that no unit of soldiers faced the enemies for a
                                            long period of time – thus making the δ low. </p>
                                        <p> Let’s now find out if it's more likely for players to cooperate with those
                                            who have cooperated with them in the past – reciprocity. Gerald S. Wilkinson
                                            studied Vampire bats that are prone to starve if they hunt unsuccessfully
                                            for a few nights in a row, but they seem to be highly thankful to the other
                                            vampire bats that feed them in times of need. When bats return from a
                                            successful hunt, they will give some of the blood in its mouth to the bats
                                            that were unsuccessful. Wilkinson showed that a previously starving bat was
                                            eager to repay the favor to the bat that helped him when he needed it the
                                            most – high reciprocity. This study shows us that reciprocity is needed for
                                            cooperation to emerge. High δ was also present in this study – a lot of
                                            vampire bats had been in the same group for a long time. </p>
                                        <p> We’ve seen our principles for cooperation embraced by humans and even by
                                            bats. What if in these interactions there was somebody who was gaining the
                                            benefits and not paying any cost? In order to sustain cooperation these so
                                            called free-riders have to be punished for reaping the benefits without
                                            paying the costs. Otherwise the cooperation would not be stable and they
                                            would benefit by deviating. The punishment for not cooperating makes it less
                                            worth it for them. If free-riders go unpunished, the cooperative individuals
                                            also tend to stop cooperating. What if, in a group, the free-riders get
                                            punished but it is costly for the punishers to punish. Why would they punish
                                            the free-riders in the first case, when they could rely on the others to do
                                            it for them and reap the benefits anyway? david nikel 3 political science
                                            For the group to sustain cooperation it has to punish the free-riders and
                                            also punish those who have not been punished even though they should have
                                            had. This second order punishment motivates the punishers to punish the
                                            free-riders. So for cooperation to be sustained another principle plays a
                                            significant role – punishment of the free-riders and punishment of those who
                                            didn't punish the free-rider but should have had. The δ still has to be high
                                            in order for the punishment to have an effect. If it is not, the punisher
                                            would punish the free-rider never to interact with him again and thus would
                                            not reap any benefits from this punishment which is costly to him. This
                                            principle of a second order punishment seems to be similar to Jeremy
                                            Bentham’s Panopticon in a sense that you would rather punish the free-rider
                                            than to get punished by others for not doing so, even though your inaction
                                            may be unwitnessed by others. Just the possibility of the punishment
                                            motivates you to punish the free-rider. </p>
                                        <p> In summary, to sustain cooperation there must be a high likelihood of
                                            repeated interaction, past behavior must be highly observable. The δ must be
                                            high. Cooperating today must yield some future benefit, like others being
                                            more likely to cooperate with you later – reciprocity. Cooperative behavior
                                            needs to be conditional – people can’t just cooperate without a reason, as
                                            they might with someone they care about unconditionally like a family member
                                            just to improve his or her wellbeing. The foundation of cooperation is not
                                            really trust, but the durability of the interaction. If the conditions are
                                            right, the players come to cooperation by trial-and-error, learning what
                                            strategy comes with the biggest payoff or through imitation of other players
                                            who are successful. Even evolution helps us by eliminating the unsuccessful
                                            strategies and leaving us with the successful ones. If the conditions for
                                            cooperation are right it will emerge no matter what. </p>

                                <p>In order to live life to its fullest potential I have to spend my time wisely. As I
                                    am limited by time, I believe I have to maximize doing the things that bring me joy
                                    and / or meaning and minimize the time spent on things that don’t. Even though I try
                                    to do that every day, I sometimes find myself in a position where I don’t spend my
                                    time as I would prefer. I want to transition from deciding on the go to a written
                                    down vision of my life in order to steer more clearly towards it and organize my
                                    thoughts.</p>
                                <p>Firstly, I have to find the activities that bring me flow. So far I have figured out
                                    that the most amount of flow I experience when doing sports. As a kid when I was
                                    playing football or other sports in school, later on skateboarding, while loud music
                                    was on, striving to learn a new trick. The intense focus and the rewarding joy after
                                    learning a new trick or just enjoying the flow brought me great satisfaction. Then
                                    as I got into reading I enjoyed flow while reading some books, but not all of them,
                                    only the interesting, well written and illuminating ones.</p>
                                <p>Secondly, I need to figure out what is meaningful for me or makes me feel that the
                                    time was spent well, not regretting doing the activity in hindsight. So far, these
                                    activities fit the category of some sort of personal growth or doing something for
                                    me in order to improve. It could be physical like a morning stretching routine,
                                    doing sports, healthy eating or efficiently relaxing and it could be more learning
                                    or creating something like reading a new book on a topic that interests me, watching
                                    videos that satisfy my curiosity or creating an amateur website that visually
                                    appeals to me.</p>
                                <p>These were the things that I consider are worth the time of their pursuit. Focusing
                                    more on the future I want to envision the life that I consider well lived from my
                                    point of view and list all the things that could help me achieve it. I think that a
                                    productive morning sets the pace for the rest of the day, so a morning routine that
                                    would energize me, wake my body up and improve my health would be of benefit. It
                                    could be a morning stretching routine while listening to a podcast of interest or
                                    relaxing music, followed by swimming / a run / a workout and a healthy breakfast.
                                    After the routine I would like to work on something that I find interesting and
                                    exciting as well as meaningful. Something that adds value to the society, improves
                                    lives of others or is just something that I enjoy doing and working on. It could be
                                    building a company, investing in companies, philanthropy or just a hobby. I am yet
                                    to find a professional route that I want to take, as of now I don’t specialize in
                                    anything. Investing caught my attention but I don’t know if that is the path most
                                    desired by me. I am willing to try it since I am learning about how businesses work
                                    that could be helpful when starting my own company, not sure if I could handle that
                                    either but as I have discovered I don’t like being bossed around and working for
                                    somebody so I may try going on my own out of necessity. So the information gathered
                                    from researching companies could be helpful. I was thinking about researching
                                    industrial companies and finding a niche there so I could apply the knowledge when
                                    starting out myself. Another professional option would be to invest in new ventures,
                                    which is meaningful for improving lives as well as an interesting career, or so I
                                    think. After coming back from my job I would like to read interesting books or
                                    socialize with friends and family. As well as do sports such as cycling, running,
                                    swimming, surfing, skiing.</p>
                                <p>Surrounding environment also influences my wellbeing. It is important for me to be
                                    woken up by natural light so a house with windows that let that morning sun in is
                                    necessary. As I am interested in aesthetically pleasing houses I would like to live
                                    in one in the future. The house should not be very large only to contain possible
                                    guests but still keep its coziness. I would prefer a modern concrete house with a
                                    view into the tree crowns or nature. In the best case with a swimming pool where I
                                    could do my morning swimming laps regardless of the weather and a wellness room with
                                    a steam and / or sauna. The house should be situated somewhere where the
                                    neighbourhood / neighbours are nice as well as close to hiking routes / cycling
                                    routes / running routes not so far from the city where other options of leisure are
                                    located.</p>
                                <p>From a family standpoint I would like a big family if I can support it. I would like
                                    to have a wife that is passionate about something and I could help her with that and
                                    see her grow. I would like her to be ambitious and sporty.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, I want to focus on things that will let me squeeze out the most of
                                    life and I think the key to that is to think and reflect on things we do, why we do
                                    them and how we feel about them. My preferences may change through time but I felt
                                    the need to write this down even though it is not so insightful for others and I may
                                    edit it in the future.</p>

                                <p>The purpose of this writing is to list all the expectations on my stay in Australia
                                    in advance so I can reflect on it later on. Unfortunately I am writing this after I
                                    have spent nine days in Adelaide already. After the arrival I was not particularly
                                    excited about being in Australia but that was likely caused by the long flight
                                    feeling very tired.</p>
                                <p>My apriori perception of Australia was mostly influenced by all the modern houses I
                                    have watched on youtube surrounded by wild nature and beaches. It was a sense of
                                    calm, beauty and robustness that appealed to me. I was envisioning a life full of
                                    activities, beautiful nature in close proximity to entertainment in the nearby
                                    cities. Nicely tailored to family / adult life. At the same time I have watched a
                                    lot of appealing videos on the lifestyle here by travelers and locals. Their daily
                                    life seemed to be full of good habits such as eating healthy, doing all kinds of
                                    sports and a rich social life. All the while surrounded by an environment full of
                                    fauna and flora and never sleeping sun. With all those benefits that seem to be
                                    present only in exotic places visited on vacations, Australia also has a strong
                                    economy with a lot of career opportunities, which appealed to me since I wanted to
                                    work in a financial industry in a developed economy. All these lead to a decision,
                                    when deciding where my life would be most well lived and of the highest quality out
                                    of all the options.</p>
                                <p>Being on my own would be a check on my independence. I viewed that uncertainty about
                                    how I would do on my own as a challenge since there is no better time to do that
                                    than now. I have watched a lot of college vlogs from abroad on youtube and thought
                                    to myself that I want to experience the proper student life as well since I have
                                    missed it studying my bachelors degree at a lenient university that was not
                                    demanding as much. My main focus would be to delve deep into the world of finance
                                    figuring out the mechanics of the financial industry and researching companies. With
                                    the knowledge from my courses I could make better informed decisions with my own
                                    investments and grow my wealth over time. The insights like different business
                                    models, industry specifics, financial workings of a company could also help me with
                                    my own ventures.</p>
                                <p>University requirements and course completion will be my primary focus of attention
                                    as well as following the financial markets. Regarding my own ventures I was thinking
                                    of finally starting some. Eventually I would like to start a platform called point
                                    on which anybody could hire professionals and services as well as an app on which
                                    you would be able to fund peoples dreams or material needs that could be used
                                    instead of gifts. I also thought about finding an industrial niche in which I would
                                    control a lot of the market share in a small total addressable market so I would not
                                    face as big of a competition. In the meantime though it would be better to start
                                    small. I would start with a simple e-shop selling t-shirts with a limited downside
                                    and capital requirements or with a knowledge sharing course marketed through
                                    socials. Completion of the goals would require an immense focus and a fight with the
                                    distractions which could be plentiful. Many people from Europe come to Australia to
                                    live a free life full of adventure and social gatherings which suits them but that
                                    could sometimes create fleeting short-lived experiences at a hidden opportunity cost
                                    of building something lasting and meaningful. This creates an ever-present
                                    optimization dilemma on how much time and effort to allocate to short-term &
                                    long-term goals, the decisions to focus on the current moment or on building
                                    something that could be of benefit in the future for a price of short-term
                                    suffering. As of now, I think it is worth being long-term oriented as I find myself
                                    feeling frustrated at the end of the day whenever I have not done something for the
                                    future or somehow improved but instead lived hedonistically for a fleeting reward.
                                    But there is nothing bad if someone lives a lifestyle focused on the present moment
                                    seeking pleasures without much planning ahead, it is just a different view on
                                    living. I do not want to get caught up on a hedonic treadmill. My other goal is to
                                    have a healthy lifestyle here that includes a routine such as stretching after
                                    waking up, eating well, active lifestyle doing sports and reading a lot.</p>
                                <p>So far I am under the impression that many of the students in my building are not so
                                    social as they are avoiding eye contact as well as conversations. After these
                                    interactions I feel more socially disconnected. On the other hand it limits me to
                                    the exposure of distraction from the goals that I want to be primarily focused on,
                                    my goal is not to make as many friends as possible nor is it to spend the most time
                                    partying or hanging out.</p>
                                <p>Hopefully I will reach the goals in the next two years and things will turn out for
                                    the better. Let the time work its magic.</p>

                                <p>Striving for a harmonious family life requires a responsible decision making process
                                    when choosing a potential life partner, it should focus on desired traits that lead
                                    to a prosperous relationship. Filtering out the undesired ones, thus focusing more
                                    on prevention rather than treatment in the form of resolving redundant conflicts
                                    when they arise. Conflicts between the partners are going to happen either way but
                                    the overall energy used on resolving them could be lessened by choosing the partner
                                    wisely and thus could be directed to more productive things. We all evaluate others,
                                    sometimes unconsciously, in the form of choosing friends that have the same
                                    interests, values, personalities or any other selected traits. As I have observed, a
                                    lot of conflicts that arise between partners are preventable when thought out in
                                    advance. But I suppose that the majority of people during conflicts do not think
                                    about the root cause of what got them into the arguments nor do they reflect on it
                                    afterwards. Which condemns them to a repetition without ever leaving the loop. I do
                                    not want to get into that loop in the first place or at least have an option to
                                    escape it. I would like to list all the traits that I have observed so far – they
                                    could change in the future – that I think would lead to a more constructive and
                                    prosperous relationship.</p>
                                <p><strong><i>Ambition.</i></strong> Striving for something in life brings about meaning
                                    and fulfillment. Engaging in any activity and getting better at it is something to
                                    aim for. Improvements in sports, knowledge, career or just being a better human
                                    being is important. It also adds uniqueness to the person, since I feel like a lot
                                    of people do not set their mind on something and just steer aimlessly which could
                                    lead to self-destructing habits. Achieving a goal rewards us with dopamine and
                                    kick-starts a long-term healthy habit loop, which makes us feel better and more
                                    confident. Own goals and activities also make the person more independent of the
                                    partner which in turn reduces conflicts appearing out of boredom or excessive
                                    dependency and reliance. Healthy lifestyle in general appeals to me as well. I like
                                    when others are taking care of themselves as well as of others. Sacrificing
                                    short-term pleasure for a long-term gain comes naturally with this mindset, rather
                                    than the opposite of chasing ever-fleeting pleasure on a treadmill without ever
                                    being satiated. Growth mindset in general proves helpful in any situation when
                                    taking on a challenge or dealing with any problems that life throws at us. I find it
                                    very admirable when a person grows.</p>
                                <p><strong><i>Logic.</i></strong> Thinking logically helps almost in any life situation.
                                    It leads to better and more objective decisions thus living more efficiently. In
                                    interactions between the partners it helps to communicate more clearly and prevent
                                    misunderstandings which are common causes of conflicts. It also helps to resolve the
                                    conflicts if both sides agree upon a framework of the discussion. For instance
                                    focusing on facts and trying to solve the problem (conflict) rather than being
                                    aimlessly swayed by emotions without reaching an agreement / conclusion and learning
                                    from it so the conflict does not repeat.</p>
                                <p><strong><i>Beauty.</i></strong> Physical appearance plays a big part in our lives
                                    contrary to the polite well-meant clichés. Women with dark long hair, large eyes,
                                    big lips appeal to me – middle eastern (arabic) type. I also like when she makes
                                    various hairstyles. Skinny / sporty physiques with long legs are aesthetically
                                    pleasing. I prefer when she takes care of herself by eating healthy, doing sports,
                                    wearing elegant clothes and when she is feminine. All of those imposed beauty
                                    standards may seem shallow but I derive a lot of value from the beautiful aesthetics
                                    surrounding me and with a beautiful partner by my side I could do that all the time.
                                    </li>
                                <p><strong><i>Shared values.</i></strong> Values such as kindness, respect and an active
                                    approach to situations. Pro-actively taking action rather than passively waiting for
                                    the consequences. Preference of long-term improvement over short-term pleasure.
                                    Large family with a focus on providing the best circumstances for the family to
                                    thrive. Focus only on the things that matter to living life to the fullest and at
                                    the same time abandoning the time wasting activities. Doing things together such as
                                    sports, helping each other grow and providing helpful feedback on any topic in
                                    question will make us bond together more. Calmness and thoughfulness.</p>
                                <p>In conclusion, I strive for a life where my family has the option to go on a weekend
                                    getaway to do activities such as skiing, spending time in foreign countries, beaches
                                    and cities regularly. With enough resources to provide freedom and options for each
                                    of the family members to find his / her own source of joy in any endeavour he / she
                                    finds fit. Being independent of the resource constraints unleashes us to do whatever
                                    we want and whenever we want to. For that to become a reality I would need a partner
                                    that shares my view on future life and helps me attain it.</p>

                                <p>After a month of studying finance abroad, I have often found myself doubting the
                                    benefits of the studies. Evaluation of the initial decision to study finance abroad
                                    puzzles me. As I have tried to rate the decision I could not come to a conclusion.
                                    The problem lies when I start considering alternative paths that I could have taken
                                    instead. Or as economists would like to call them “opportunity costs”.
                                    Retrospectively I can point out the negatives and positives of the path that I have
                                    chosen but what about the other ones that have not been walked on? I could consider
                                    going to another university, another country or basically giving up studying and
                                    pursuing a career but I do not know the potential outcomes of those decisions and
                                    can not compare them with my chosen path. How can I then say that I made a wise
                                    choice? I can apply all sorts of what if thought experiments and create possible
                                    scenarios but I will never know for certain how all the consequences of the other
                                    decisions impact my life. That uncertainty on how I would react to the different
                                    circumstances makes the judgement impossible. I can not say that choosing another
                                    path would be better for me, I have no google map that can calculate the outcomes
                                    and state them in a clear metric like a travel distance, time to destination and
                                    others.</p>
                                <p>People of authority often give tips on how to do certain things, essentially telling
                                    you what the optimal path is, but that makes no sense. What worked for them does not
                                    have to apply to you. We are all born differently and with that default setup we all
                                    react to forces of destiny in different ways. Somebody who was bullied as a kid
                                    could grow up to be a driven individual and pursue excellence only because it
                                    instilled an inner motivation seed in him. Or he can become an emotionally scarred
                                    person that has to make up for the damage done to him by harming others in order to
                                    gain his self-worth back, never willing to improve himself. Why does an objectively
                                    bad thing lead to a value creating outcome and a value destroying one in the second
                                    case. This decision tree grows if you consider all the forces that influence our
                                    behaviour. I do not think that you can know the influence of factors a priori to the
                                    events happening. As rational human beings, how do we decide on what to do next when
                                    we do not know the outcomes? How do we evaluate the decisions in order to learn from
                                    them to pursue our future endeavours? As of now I came to a conclusion that I can
                                    not judge my past decisions and score them on how good they were. I can not even
                                    know what my future actions will cause and what effects they will have on me (not
                                    considering the obvious things like smoking ten packs of cigs a day).</p>
                                <p>That leads me to think that decisions lead to outcomes that may have not been
                                    intended and thus do not make the decision maker fully accountable for the credit if
                                    it goes well and otherwise. These decisions were influenced by previous decisions
                                    and outcomes and you could extend this reasoning to the beginning of everything.
                                    Which leads to doubting free will as we do not have control over factors that have
                                    had an impact on us from the beginning. These impacts are essentially random so are
                                    my decisions random? Am I making these decisions because I have a free will or has
                                    it been decided for me by the preceding actions and their influences on me?</p>
                                <p>As I have tried evaluating my finance studies I considered my focused attention with
                                    low clarity of all that effort translating to a more prosperous career. I have read
                                    a lot on the topic of financial markets out of my genuine interest and hoped that
                                    would provide me with an intellectual advantage over peers but it seems like school
                                    has been leveling the playing field for everyone. It takes my time away from
                                    exploring things that I am interested in outside of the school curriculum and thus
                                    assimilating my knowledge to the knowledge of my peers because we all learn the same
                                    things. Which leads to unoriginality and a limited spectrum of knowledge which could
                                    be exploited by someone who has a different point of view on things. This mechanism
                                    seems to be holding us closely with not much differentiation when applying to a
                                    potential job. But historically, people have been rewarded for thinking differently.
                                </p>
                                <p>The path in front of me seems to be a corporate job in which I do a lot of
                                    spreadsheets. Climbing up the corporate ladder would require competing with others
                                    that may be genetically more bright or just more fit for the job. Climbing up the
                                    hierarchy would be so energy draining as I would be forced to do tasks that I do not
                                    like. Everything that I am forced to do under resentment I find so hard to do. I
                                    like to do things my own way. Not how I am told to do it. This phenomenon shaped my
                                    life as I have tried to always find my way of doing something. I do not think I
                                    would thrive in a forcing environment based on hierarchy and authoritarian power.
                                    But that is required in corporate finance jobs. I also reflected on myself and
                                    realized that I am more of a story than numbers person in finance. I believe that
                                    there are people that have better abilities to do quantitative work in banks, hedge
                                    funds, private equity funds, consulting and other employers. I enjoy listening to
                                    podcasts about how companies make money, what is their history, how they have made
                                    the product work et cetera. So maybe I should delve deeper into how the venture
                                    capital industry works or startups in general. That is where the story plays a key
                                    role. I listened to some of the interviews with Doug Leone and was inspired by his
                                    insights and wisdom. I enjoyed reading The Venture Mindset book as well as The Power
                                    Law. I find it fascinating how they are able to participate in building so many
                                    value creating companies. I will research the industry a little more to find out if
                                    I am steering my ship to the shore with the treasure on board or not. If not I have
                                    to look again for some.</p>

                                <p>We face competition everywhere. The thought of competing with others and striving to
                                    outperform peers during the career or academic life exhausts me. In school we are
                                    always getting graded and socially viewed through the lens of grades. It does not
                                    necessarily mean that someone who scores better on tests is a better human being as
                                    is obvious to everyone. Still, the psychological effect it could have on individuals
                                    in a peer group could be future defining for the individual. It could spur drive or
                                    lead to lack of confidence ventilated through acts of violence or other immoral
                                    acts, as one reacts to the negative feedback from the tribe that he had to be
                                    historically aligned with. Rejection from the tribe meant nearly certain death.
                                    Everyone wants to be socially accepted in their own way, some pursue it through
                                    careers, others doing good for the world by working for a charity, could be
                                    anything, even being part of a distinct football fan group. As long as that means
                                    being positively evaluated by peers of the group.</p>
                                <p>This leads to social signalling. We all signal certain things and once you look at it
                                    from a third person perspective, looking at the interactions between people, looking
                                    around at the fans on a football field or just noticing how people present
                                    themselves to gain the evaluation by others, forms an interesting view on human
                                    behavior. Witnessing cost signalling in society is so interesting, firstly it could
                                    be seen as stupid but it makes sense! Animals do that too. Peacocks show their
                                    mating rituals to potential mating partners, increasingly exposing themselves to the
                                    predators. Why would they do that? They signal that even though they are exposing
                                    themselves, they feel comfortable fleeing from the potential predator due to their
                                    gifted DNA, signalling mating attractiveness to the female. Humans signal too. We
                                    show our luxury items just to signal everyone that we can spend so much money and
                                    still have money for the normal goods, signalling status. We show it with our ripped
                                    bodies that we have the time to spend in the gym, signalling our health and the
                                    amount of free time we have and other things that we hope are evaluated by peers. It
                                    is most effective when it is perceived as unintended. I suspect that there is
                                    something going on in a similar vein when students choose to study just for the sake
                                    of getting a degree.</p>
                                <p>As I have encountered some of the peers at my university I am left thinking that a
                                    lot of the students do not study for the sake of learning because they are
                                    interested in the field, rather they seem to study in order to get a more
                                    prestigious job in a corporate setting. I thought it would be mostly people that go
                                    to sleep thinking about finance (as I am studying that), dreaming about it and
                                    reading financial news as a pre-breakfast meal, ready to discuss anything, anytime.
                                    As that was one of my reasons to study abroad, to meet people with such an interest.
                                    I can only speculate on what the actual motivation for studying is. I think it could
                                    be more hidden motives. I think it is some form of uncertainty reduction which is
                                    unpleasant to human beings as well as a status symbol by showing endurance and
                                    intelligence. By studying they dodge the immediate bullet of responsibility that
                                    would be fired at them as they enter the corporate world, as well as improving the
                                    odds of a prestigious job in the future. But where does that lead to? If sufficient
                                    amounts of people follow the same path they will all end up competing with each
                                    other for jobs in the financial industry. Cutthroat competition in a hierarchical
                                    corporate structure does not seem to be fun pursuing. Sacrificing a lot of time
                                    studying, which is our most valuable asset, just to compete with other status
                                    seeking humans with similar education in an environment that does not always reward
                                    performance and merit seems foolish. Instead of choosing to compete one can
                                    differentiate himself. With differentiation comes a unique value proposition that
                                    cannot be found elsewhere, thus, if positive, sought after and valued appropriately.
                                </p>
                                <p>One can think of it as games that we choose to play. If we compete with a lot of
                                    other players, chances are that some of them would outperform us. Some games become
                                    increasingly harder to win at. As certain “games” become more popular, players
                                    advance and become better at playing them. This reduces the odds of outsized gains
                                    for the new entrants. For instance, in the past there was a huge difference between
                                    the performance of sprinters as the best of the best outran others by a wide margin
                                    measured by seconds for short distance runners, more recently the difference has
                                    become increasingly smaller, thus giving luck more steering control over the
                                    outcomes. The same happened in public equity markets investing. As information and
                                    knowledge were scarce, investors with access to proprietary information and analytic
                                    approaches outperformed other investors by a wide margin. As markets have become
                                    more informed, due to the improvements in technology and knowledge, the margin
                                    shrank, thus causing uncertainty if it is even worth it to play the game of beating
                                    the market (competing with others). This general principle is present in scientific
                                    discovery, startup markets, and any kind of specialization. You have to be the first
                                    to do it in a certain way to gain an edge over others. To come up with a different
                                    approach. To look at a problem in a different way and be on the cutting edge of
                                    development. Most famous people are famous because they are different from others,
                                    they have certain traits that people adore or value that others lack.</p>
                                <p>Differentiation leads to being contrarian. One has to be a contrarian but he also has
                                    to be right. I do think that relying on school to give us all the knowledge needed
                                    is a fool’s errand. At the end of the day, an individual should find a unique path
                                    that fits him. Learn a skill that others can not do or are not willing to do. Come
                                    up with a different approach to do things. Otherwise one is condemned to mediocrity
                                    with suboptimal fulfillment, results and constant competition. To walk on the path
                                    of differentiation, one should find enjoyment in something natural to him that
                                    guides him in the right direction. I do not quite get why schools do not focus more
                                    on finding the strengths of the students and helping them figure out what could suit
                                    them. The curriculum seems to be structured just to give us facts. Here is a
                                    formula, input the numbers and you get this output, without sufficient reasoning on
                                    why we are even doing that in the first place. Why is it not structured as working
                                    backwards from the goals and thus portraying a story that makes more sense and is
                                    easily remembered. Pragmatism should be at the heart of all and telling the why of
                                    things is so important that it can not be emphasized enough. Yet not many people ask
                                    the why of things, why are they the way they are, they are satisfied with the status
                                    quo because that is how it should be, right?</p>

                                <p>I have been feeling frustrated for the past few days for some reason. The reason for this writing is mainly that I do not have anybody to share my thoughts with and somehow reason through them. In part because nobody wants to hear the problems of other people and I would expect to get some shallow answers without any real interest in finding a solution with thoughtfulness that could be of value to me. Thus it is not worth starting the discussion in the first place. My first final exams are taking place in two weeks and I can not get myself to study for the exams even though I dedicate almost all of my free time to learning about similar topics that I am going to be examined on. I am going to be examined on finance, accounting, economics and quantitative methods which are all topics that I casually read books on, listen to podcasts and watch videos on. I can not wrap my head around why I am so reluctant to study these topics for the exams. The resistance that I feel could be due to the mere fact that I perceive it as a worthless goal to pursue for reasons unconsciously woven into me (maybe consciously.. as I spend some time thinking about it). The fact that I have to prove that I have dedicated the time to the studies in order to succeed at the test disgusts me. Why should I do that? I do not feel the need to prove how hardworking or intelligent I am and get scored on that. The score does not even fully reflect that. The only reason that would be useful is to signal to the potential employer how conforming I am that I can do all that without any sign of reluctance and opinion so that I would be a voiceless, opinionless working bee that does only what it is told to and no more if that is what he is looking for. Instead of being tested like in a lab experiment and stamped for passing the test I would rather apply the knowledge on real world problems or practical projects that interest me personally and thus I can learn more due because I am emotionally invested in the idea. Some could argue that we do that in school but I disagree. The fact that there is a scoring system destroys so many learning opportunities. Students are afraid to make mistakes to reach the perfect marks and are unwilling to learn something that is not required or irrelevant to the things that they will be tested on even though it adds immense value to really grasp the subject studied. Personally, I do not learn much unless I see how it relates to something I am interested in. The choice of the projects adds to the interest because it comes from students' own decisions, they spend more time researching, making mistakes and thus learning and the learning experience would be thrusted towards the orbit if they could ask as many questions as they could and figure stuff on their own instead of taking facts as granted (to some limit). The joy of asking why is so underappreciated. I would learn much more If I could apply concepts from the syllabus of the course to my favourite companies instead of abstract examples that do not resonate with me at all and do not spur any new questions in my mind. Basically, I do not see the value in the high score I am going to get as It has no relevance to the things I am interested in. I bet even the students that score highly do not retain the vast majority of the knowledge as they are cramming just before the exams for the sake of scoring well without their own inner interest in the topic. The perceived meaninglessness of the score does not motivate me to study as it is a target offering no payoff through my own lens. I did not want to get into all that but that spontaneously came out of me, so fair enough. </p>
                                <p>At the same time I know I have to pass the exams and should study for them but there is so much interesting stuff lying around me. I feel an immense sense of frustration when I am not learning something about the things of interest, I regret the time spent otherwise. I can not help myself, it just is that way and I can not envision myself living on a hedonic treadmill, by that I mean doing things for short-term pleasure and for the “experience” (with so called you only live once mindset that and “interesting life” that I think is forced by social media), like a lot of people that come to Australia seem to be. I am trying to put together a sound investment philosophy, strategy and portfolio construction and make a website to put it all on. In order to do all that I have numerous books to go through mostly on chaos theory (how to think about markets), competitive advantages of specific companies (moats) and valuation. All the things I have read have to be applied to specific companies and write them up in order to allocate some funds available to my portfolio. That requires reading a lot of company/industry specific texts and making sense of it through the lens of complex adaptive systems (chaos) and moats. In the process of monitoring and constructing my own portfolio I expect to learn a lot about various industries and company dynamics. As of now, I have pre-filtered some fields of interest such as niche manufacturers, industrials, luxury and financial infrastructure companies. I want to learn more about serial acquirers such as LIFCO, Constellation Software, Danaher, LVMH, Kelly Partners Group, Topicus and others.</p>
                                <p>I would love to discuss the topics of interest with some of my peers but I can not find any. I have tried and spoke to a few people but I did not get thoughtful answers back. Most of them have the depth of a fairly sophisticated TikTok video. That does not mean a lack of intelligence, just a lack of time invested in developing these ideas in their free time. I look for somebody naturally curious that does not fall for the first thing that he/she sees on social media like short-term trading get rich quick schemes. No AI nonsense in every sentence or a great marketing idea. And to be honest it does not even have to do anything with business (but would prefer if it did), as human behaviour, layman philosophy or psychology is of my interest as well. Or basically anything with some thought involved. I mention that often because I just get that feeling of shallowness from so many discussions. I will continue to be on the lookout for someone to discuss topics of interest with.</p>
