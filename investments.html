                          <strong>In a nutshell</strong>
                          <p>Moody’s Corporation is a long-term compounder with high barriers to entry, huge pricing power and growth tailwinds.</p>
                         
                          <strong>Investment Thesis</strong>
                          <p>The rating agency business model is excellent. It benefits from the deep entrenchment into the financial industry, pricing power and low capital intensity.</p>
                          <p>Rising debt issuance and increasing market share of bonds as percentage of overall debt issuance will be the gas propelling the business forward. Competitive markets drive down the returns on capital of most projects over time, so companies / governments will search for ways to reduce costs in order to deliver returns in excess of the required rate of return. They can achieve that by issuing more debt, changing their proportion of debt to equity, so they lower their overall cost of capital (funding costs). Basically the market will force companies to issue more debt in the long-term in order to be competitive. As market economies mature, the financing shifts from bank loans to the bond market. Developed capital markets enable companies to raise capital through the sale of bonds, which is crowd-sourced, more global, cheaper, more liquid and less restrictive.</p>
                          <p>The three rating agencies became the standard for debt rating by legislation. The mandatory usage of rating “languages” (rating grades) by the professionals created a protocol for communicating the riskiness of debt that was shared by others (network effect). Thus creating a huge competitive advantage for the incumbents as it would be too impractical for the practitioners to learn all the new languages of the new entrants in contrast with using the already widely shared ones created by the trusted incumbent rating agencies. There has never been a monopoly or more than 4 dominant rating agencies in this market over its 100 year history. Lawmakers made them disclose the methodologies and data of the ratings and even that didn’t put them out of business because of the cost of debt savings when rated by the prominent agencies as opposed to other rating agencies.</p>
                          <p>Ratings are useful as information filtering and so they are highly valued by the markets. Moody’s analysis suggests that its rating saves the average issuer 30 basis points of interest cost per year relative to no rating. In Heineken’s example it saved 30-50 basis points of yearly interest coverage and that is, for a business that faces low technological disruption, isn’t complex and is conservatively controlled, a potentially underestimation by Moody’s study. So assuming the pricing for a bond rating is ~7 basis points there is a gap between the value created for the customers and its pricing, room for an increase in pricing. If we assume a yearly price increase of 10% it takes ~15 years until the price matches the value provided.</p>
                          <p>The business model is low capital intensive. Analysts, software developers and office space is their main expense so they are able to return a significant portion of their earnings to shareholders.</p>
                          <p>Moody’s has huge pricing power, the competition faces high barriers to entry => high certainty of terminal value, has huge growth tailwinds, that growth flows to the bottom line due to the low capital intensity, thus is able to deploy much of the earnings to shareholders and function as a toll taker on global debt.</p>
