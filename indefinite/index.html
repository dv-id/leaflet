                            Interactions between agents in the equity markets form complex phenomena
                            such as feedback loops, periods of clustered volatility and power law outcomes.
                            These emergent properties are not obvious from studying individuals, rather they become
                            apparent only from the view of the whole system.
                            The market functions as an evolutionary system that is in constant flux, inherently unstable
                            and continously evolving.
                            As the system keeps evolving and adapting to new conditions, every shift is enhanced by
                            others.
                            This in turn forms chaotic behaviour that is unpredictable, non-linear and unintuitive.

                            Limit long-term forecasts, embrace companies with adaptability, optionality, resistance of
                            disruption (rare), reject the notion of risk as variance based on normal distribution,
                            opportunistically deploy capital in times of clustered volatility. Expectations investing

                            <strong>In a nutshell</strong>
                            <p>Moody’s Corporation is a long-term compounder with high barriers to entry, huge
                                pricing power and growth tailwinds.</p>

                            <strong>Investment Thesis</strong>
                            <p>The rating agency business model is excellent. It benefits from the deep entrenchment
                                into the financial industry, pricing power and low capital intensity.</p>
                            <p>Rising debt issuance and increasing market share of bonds as percentage of overall
                                debt issuance will be the gas propelling the business forward. Competitive markets
                                drive down the returns on capital of most projects over time, so companies /
                                governments will search for ways to reduce costs in order to deliver returns in
                                excess of the required rate of return. They can achieve that by issuing more debt,
                                changing their proportion of debt to equity, so they lower their overall cost of
                                capital (funding costs). Basically the market will force companies to issue more
                                debt in the long-term in order to be competitive. As market economies mature, the
                                financing shifts from bank loans to the bond market. Developed capital markets
                                enable companies to raise capital through the sale of bonds, which is crowd-sourced,
                                more global, cheaper, more liquid and less restrictive.</p>
                            <p>The three rating agencies became the standard for debt rating by legislation. The
                                mandatory usage of rating “languages” (rating grades) by the professionals created a
                                protocol for communicating the riskiness of debt that was shared by others (network
                                effect). Thus creating a huge competitive advantage for the incumbents as it would
                                be too impractical for the practitioners to learn all the new languages of the new
                                entrants in contrast with using the already widely shared ones created by the
                                trusted incumbent rating agencies. There has never been a monopoly or more than 4
                                dominant rating agencies in this market over its 100 year history. Lawmakers made
                                them disclose the methodologies and data of the ratings and even that didn’t put
                                them out of business because of the cost of debt savings when rated by the prominent
                                agencies as opposed to other rating agencies.</p>
                            <p>Ratings are useful as information filtering and so they are highly valued by the
                                markets. Moody’s analysis suggests that its rating saves the average issuer 30 basis
                                points of interest cost per year relative to no rating. In Heineken’s example it
                                saved 30-50 basis points of yearly interest coverage and that is, for a business
                                that faces low technological disruption, isn’t complex and is conservatively
                                controlled, a potentially underestimation by Moody’s study. So assuming the pricing
                                for a bond rating is ~7 basis points there is a gap between the value created for
                                the customers and its pricing, room for an increase in pricing. If we assume a
                                yearly price increase of 10% it takes ~15 years until the price matches the value
                                provided.</p>
                            <p>The business model is low capital intensive. Analysts, software developers and office
                                space is their main expense so they are able to return a significant portion of
                                their earnings to shareholders.</p>
                            <p>Moody’s has huge pricing power, the competition faces high barriers to entry => high
                                certainty of terminal value, has huge growth tailwinds, that growth flows to the
                                bottom line due to the low capital intensity, thus is able to deploy much of the
                                earnings to shareholders and function as a toll taker on global debt.</p>

                            <strong>In a nutshell</strong>
                            <p>Fair Isaac Corporation is a well positioned long-term compounder with significant
                                pricing power and an upcoming tailwind propelling it forward. FICO is esentially a
                                global toll taker on consumer debt.</p>

                            <strong>Investment Thesis</strong>
                            <p>Fair Isaac Corporation is a leading credit analytics company. It has become deeply
                                entrenched in the financial system and is widely used by lenders, investors,
                                regulators and others. The company has two segments: Scores and Software.</p>
                            <p>Its FICO Score has become a standard in global credit consumer ratings. It is used to
                                assess the creditworthiness of a borrower on a scale from 300 to 850 based on the
                                data provided by the three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian, Equifax), FICO does
                                not store any data. The Score is the result of FICO’s proprietary algorithm applied
                                to the data. The Formula is based on payment history (35%), credit utilization
                                (30%), length of credit history (15%), credit mix (10%), new credit (10%). The score
                                is then used in credit reports provided by the bureaus to their customers such as
                                mortgage originators, banks, credit card issuers, lenders and others. A higher FICO
                                Score leads to lower interest rates and loan terms.</p>
                            <p>Before 1960 there was no easy way to lend money because there was limited information
                                about the borrowers, that limitation led to gathering data about relationships and
                                other personal data that weren’t as helpful, so lenders charged a single flat rate
                                to all the borrowers. The accumulation of data and applied scoring systems enabled
                                variable interest rates based on the credit solvency of an individual. In the
                                beginning the scoring systems were simply derived from questionnaires that included
                                lots of questions and details that turned out not so objective, but still valuable
                                to the companies because they could use variable rates and conditions. Since then
                                the scoring systems have helped to personally tailor the conditions and reduce the
                                uncertainty that would be projected into higher interest rates for all the lenders
                                to compensate for the risk that the lenders are taking on themselves.</p>
                            <p>In 1974 Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed and it prohibited lending on
                                variables such as gender, race and marital status. FICO’s founders Bill Fair and
                                Earl Isaac, mathematicians from MIT, saw this as an opportunity to create objective
                                scoring. Since the FICO Score became available in 1989 it has become the standard
                                protocol to communicate creditworthiness, although an alternative exists created by
                                the three credit bureaus called the VantageScore, FICO Score is used by 90% of the
                                top 100 U.S. lenders, 99% of credit securitizations, 90% of credit lending use
                                cases. In 1995 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac institutionalized the FICO Score by making
                                it required for all mortgage originations that they handled. Today more than 230
                                million Americans can be scored by the FICO Score.</p>
                            <p>Lenders shifting from fixed flat rates to variable rates required customers to be
                                scored or they would be either denied the loan or provided the loan under bad terms
                                for the borrower. More people started to get scored and as more people got scored
                                the scores became more entrenched in the system creating a huge network effect to
                                the point of a FICO Score being widely used almost without a competition. The
                                dominant position with a huge network effect leads to untapped pricing power.</p>
                            <p>FICO’s stable growth comes from increasing pricing over time and the growth of
                                volumes of credit ratings done. FICO did not raise prices until 2018 leaving a
                                runway for raising prices from then on. It is still relatively cheap (3,50$ per
                                score) when compared to the tri-merge credit report (50-70$) and even more when
                                compared to the ~5 500$ of closing costs per mortgage as well as ~320 000$ of
                                average mortgage loan. The price increase (likely mid to high teens) is also passed
                                on through the credit bureau to the lender and finally to the borrower. Usually the
                                financial institutions are agnostic to the price increases since they are just
                                passed on. The price increases come with ~95%+ margins. The Scores business is a
                                highly profitable (operating margins north of 85%) monopoly-like business that
                                generates a lot of FCF. A lot of companies also build on top of the FICO score and
                                use their own analytic methods. FICO also has a B2C - myFICO - business that is ~⅓
                                of the revenue of the Scores segment. It allows the users to monitor their scoring
                                from the credit bureaus data and it is a subscription business. FICO also does
                                partnerships that monitor credit with third parties and FICO receives royalties, it
                                helps to create the network effect for the market to use the FICO score.</p>
                            <p>FICO’s software business requires a lot of capital expenditures financed by the
                                Scores business. There isn’t so much cross selling between the two businesses but
                                since Scores are already widely used by a lot of the players in the financial
                                industry it makes sense for them to try using the software as well. The software
                                segment is much less cyclical because it is sold on a multi-year subscription with
                                payments based on usage. Some of the software services help with fraud detection
                                which is used in ⅔ of credit card transactions worldwide and can reduce fraud losses
                                up to 50% (fraudulent transactions, identity theft,..) more than 9000 institutions
                                provide data for the for the analytical AI model to assess the fraudulency which
                                creates network effect as well. Other offerings help with loan origination, customer
                                management, financial crimes compliance, marketing and optimization problems. FICO
                                plans to move all the software offerings to its subscription platform. In the
                                software segment it competes with different players in each of the services it
                                provides, it has a 30% operating margin.</p>
                            <p>Overall the business is very sound. It is not easy to replicate. Even if someone came
                                up with a comparable scoring system it would not be enough to disrupt the FICO Score
                                because of its deep entrenchment in the financial system (network effect). It is
                                hard to disrupt a widely used and trusted protocol (the Score) => dominant market
                                position. Pricing power stems from the dominant position and a big runway for price
                                increases. The business is capital light with just 25 million CAPEX on 1,7B sales
                                (~1,5%) - not much reinvestment is required for the business to keep going and
                                growing. The management uses that excess capital to buy back stock - bought back 20%
                                of outstanding shares over the last 5 years and 25% over the last 10 years
                                demonstrating shareholder centered approach. The valuation may seem to be stretched
                                but going forward the pricing power combined with low reinvestment needs and
                                buybacks (hopefully when the price is right) create a long-term compounding engine.
                                That will become more recognized when the mortgage origination volume picks up again
                                sometime in the future (as expected by the Mortgage Bankers Association) from the
                                recent lows creating a huge tailwind for the business.</p>

                            <strong>In a nutshell</strong>
                            <p>InterDigital is a highly profitable business with a digitalization tailwind and huge
                                optionality.</p>

                            <strong>Investment Thesis</strong>
                            <p>InterDigital “($IDCC)” is one of the largest pure R&D and licensing companies focused
                                primarily on wireless, video, artificial intelligence and related technologies.
                                Their technology has been licensed to ~7B devices and it owns ~32,000 patents. These
                                patents are predominantly to cellular wireless standards - 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G, Wi-Fi
                                technology, video technologies and standards. Customers include Amazon, Apple (for
                                each 500$ phone InterDigital earns ~1,15$), Lenovo Group, Google, LG Electronics,
                                Samsung Electronics, Sony Corporation of America and Xiaomi Corporation, among
                                others.</p>
                            <p>Digitalization is a strong tailwind for InterDigital, the more devices that need to
                                talk to each other fill up the electromagnetic spectrum which is owned by the
                                government that auctions it to the wireless carriers. There is a limited supply with
                                a growing demand dynamic. InterDigital owns patents that optimize the allocation of
                                the spectrum thus maximizing the auctioned piece for the wireless carriers,
                                providing huge value. As smartphones, cars and IoT devices need to talk to each
                                other they have to communicate in a standardized way, again with some of the patents
                                owned by InterDigital.</p>
                            <p>InterDigital derives revenues primarily from patent license agreements, these are
                                fixed-fee, with a smaller portion coming from variable royalty agreements. When
                                entering into a new patent license agreement the prior unlicensed use will be billed
                                for, called catch-up payment/revenue, that is 100% margin, in addition to the
                                license fees and royalties for the agreement. Variable royalty license agreements
                                give InterDigital the right to audit the licensees’ books and records to comply with
                                the agreement, if underpayments are revealed InterDigital seeks the amount owed. But
                                usually the agreements are fixed-fee because the auditing process is resource
                                demanding for a company of ~4B market cap. Its highest expense is R&D ~35% of
                                revenue. InterDigital has over a billion for litigation, it does not play to return
                                that capital to shareholders, because it is essential to stay competitive and
                                enforce infringements.</p>
                            <p>As much as 50 % of smartphone companies that are using InterDigital patents are not
                                paying for it. These companies are mostly in China and Africa where the institutions
                                are not set up to respect patterns. Although recently Oppo group which is one of the
                                largest smartphone manufacturers in China signed a license agreement with
                                InterDigital. As the company progresses to sign more agreements with those that are
                                not paying, it gets a lump sum payment and a long-term contract, which is an
                                opportunity for growth. Untapped potential lies also in the cloud streaming market
                                where the majority of the players are already using InterDigitals technology but yet
                                have not paid for it, HD video download / upload encoding. It is inconceivable to
                                not get paid in the future. Both of these opportunities are like a huge option that
                                you basically get for free if InterDigital can gain market share similar to other
                                patents and enforce these patterns.</p>
                            <p>The patents are protected by 20 years but after that there is no patent cliff.
                                Continual patents development, for example they already have patents for 6G which
                                will come after at least 6 years, and continual use of the old patents by companies
                                since a lot of the new devices have to be able to communicate using even the older
                                patents.</p>
                            <p>The Company faces competition from firms like Qualcomm, Nokia, Ericsson, but these
                                companies all use the patents for their own products in contrast with InterDigital,
                                which is an unbiased, pure research oriented, licensing business. The competition is
                                mainly stagnant in its revenue, with profits all over the place, while InterDigital
                                is growing. Paradoxically they are traded at 6 to 40 times the market cap.
                                InterDigital is comparable to Dolby which trades at a TTM P/E of 30 compared to
                                InterDigital 18.5 and with a higher growth.</p>
                            <p>The licensing business is long-term subscription-like agreements with some lump sum
                                payments and occasional price increases. It is a stable high margin, 36-37% profit
                                margin, business with low capital intensity, big buybacks, huge optionality in the
                                cloud / streaming business that is trading at a low multiple.</p>

                            <strong>In a nutshell</strong>
                            <p>Siemens Energy is toll taker on infrastructure servicing with issues in its wind
                                segment behind the company is set up to grow its network effect by entrenching
                                itself deeply into the energy infrastructure.</p>

                            <strong>Investment Thesis</strong>
                            <p>Siemens Energy (ENR) is a leading company active in the energy technology and service
                                value chain. The company is a leader in some segments in the electricity generation
                                and has a dominant position in other segments. Demand for its offerings are hugely
                                leveraged by the megatrends in electricity power demand – electrification, AI energy
                                needs and decarbonization.</p>
                            <p>ENR was spun out from Siemens in 2020. ENR comprises four segments: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Gas Services</strong> (~31% of revenue, FY28 target - revenue LSD / MSD,
                                    net margin 12-14%, backlog €45b ~80% service, #2 in Gas turbines > 10MW) <br>
                                    design, manufacture, and service of gas and large steam turbines, large
                                    generators, and heat pumps.</li>
                                <li><strong>Grid Technologies</strong> (~26% of revenue, FY28 target - revenue LDD,
                                    net margin 13-15%, backlog €33b, #1 Solutions, #2 Products) <br> solving the
                                    complexity of integrating renewable energy into the energy grid infrastructure.

                                <li><strong>Transformation of Industry</strong> (~14% of revenue, FY28 target -
                                    revenue HSD, net margin 10-12%, backlog ~€8b ~30% service, #1 Steam Tech.

                                <li><strong>Siemens Gamesa </strong>(~29% of revenue, FY28 target - revenue LSD /
                                    MSD, net margin 3-5%, backlog €38b 50% service, #1 Offshore, #3 Onshore) <br>
                                    design development, and installation of products in the renewable energy sector
                                    with a focus on onshore and offshore wind turbines.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Overall, the world's growing hunger for power, limited by the current industry’s
                                capacity and the shift to decarbonization, requires a lot of investments. Current
                                environment – electrification, decarbonization, increasing population and living
                                standards, growth in data centers, aging infrastructure, global warming – serves the
                                business well as tailwinds in each of the segments propel ENR forward. The shift
                                from coal to gas as well as the need for peaking as renewables grow in numbers
                                serves GS. Aging infrastructure in advanced economies needs to be replaced (as much
                                as 50% by 2030) which is good for GT as well as the digitalization trend which helps
                                GT’s digital solutions. Solving decarbonization helps ToI’s business by forcing more
                                firms to seek solutions that help them reduce CO2 emissions. Finally, demand for
                                wind energy should serve Siemens Gamesa well. </p>
                            <p>The wind energy segment – Siemens Gamesa – ran into issues within its wind turbine
                                manufacturing segment caused by cost inflation and quality related issues that led
                                to big losses in the segment that significantly brought down the whole company. I
                                believe the issues are over as the contracts are being structured with escalation
                                clauses for inflation (hard to hedge years in the future, these costs should be
                                passed on to the owners and the demand for ENR’s products should make it
                                transferable) and the quality issues are being managed as stated in Q1 2024 earnings
                                call:</p>
                            <p><em>“I am happy to share that we have not suffered any further setbacks in onshore
                                    wind, and that offshore ramp up is progressing in line with our plans.”</em></p>
                            <p>and</p>
                            <p><em>“We have materially completed the root cause analysis for the priority one
                                    quality issues [in onshore wind], and for 80% of these we have short-term
                                    measures in place. We have already defined long-term corrective actions for half
                                    of the quality issues for half of the quality issues, while we continue to
                                    implement remediation and mitigations actions.”</em></p>
                            <p>The company also began taking orders for its onshore wind segment. As the company
                                distances itself from the issue and it becomes clear that they are profitable (or
                                break-even) on the wind business (break-even target FY26) interested investors will
                                likely return.</p>
                            <p>Siemens Energy has many competitive advantages. As a 178 year old company it has a
                                long track record of delivering engineering excellence and trusted service, plus it
                                has a strong balance sheet with €7,2b in cash. All that is important for contractors
                                that sign a long-term service agreement with ENR to make sure that the company is
                                going to be around for a long time to service the equipment. It is especially
                                valuable for states (national grid operators) that the contractor will be around
                                long in the future. With the already consolidated market (offshore wind just GE /
                                ENR and Vestas), recent war conflicts in the world focused states on energy security
                                and motivated them to minimize the reliance on unreliable suppliers, thus I think
                                (at least for the state backed projects) there won’t be many foreign entrants
                                especially from China, Russia and the like. Despite ENR and GE Vernova being almost
                                the same business with the same revenue, backlog, forward potential margin, GE
                                Vernova trades at 2,6% FCF yield compared to ENR’s 3% as well as GEV EV/EBITDA of
                                ~63 compared to ENR’s multiple of ~11 and even grew faster.</p>
                            <p>Brand name of a company that has been around for that long can’t be replicated and
                                creates barriers to entry as well as a network effect. As demand for its products
                                grow, propelled by tailwinds (as we are early in the supercycle of renewing the
                                grid), Siemens Energy builds infrastructure that has to be also serviced by them
                                which comes with high margins (above 20%). So even if they sell the assets at a
                                slight loss they still get the sticky high margin contracts. Owning the assets and
                                servicing them comes with high pricing power as well and with the current backlog of
                                ENR ~€123b ENR can cherry pick the contracts with best terms and conditions (one of
                                which could be price increases). It is also relatively low capital intensity with
                                CAPEX to sales = ~4,4%. With a network effect in place each additional
                                infrastructure piece placed down by ENR leads to high value in the future. ENR’s
                                products play a major role in the future functioning grid that generates energy with
                                ENR’s products, is connected to the grid by ENR’s products, is moved around with
                                ENR’s products and all that is serviced by ENR – a huge ecosystem. Basically a
                                future where Siemens Energy is everywhere around you, but you don’t notice it in
                                daily life.</p>
